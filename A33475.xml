            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:98927:3"/>a poſture, as they might prove commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to friends, as beneficiall to my ſelfe; being alſo unwilling, the labour and paines ſhould be altogether loſt of this nature, ſince for many yeers paſt; not any one Romance, hath been written in the Engliſh tongue; when as daily from other Nations, ſo many of all ſorts fly into the World to be ſeen: however for a long time theſe reaſons could not prevaile with the Author; yet, whether out of any diffidence in apprehenſion, or for other ſecret cauſes, I cannot tell: but at last by much importunity, joyned together with other particular relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of my own, I obtained a grant of my requeſt, provided I uſed not the Authors name, in the printing or publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of the ſame.

This enterpriſe gave as earneſt warning to <hi>Artaxis</hi> to be dilligent in providing Forces to ſuppreſſe the example, and puniſh the eſteemed Rebellion, that elſe might prove a leading Card as he thought, to the quiet ſtate of the reſt of his Dominions, that began already to waver in their obedience, as it did deſire in my Father to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what he had got, though it were with never ſo great a violence and hazard: In the firſt place <hi>Artaxis</hi> diſpatches Ambaſſadors, not onely to all his friends in other Countries, laying before them the dangerous conſequences of ſuch a Revolt; but alſo ſent Meſſengers to his owne Subjects, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them with the feare of the Rebells inſolencie, however his endeavours ſo little proſpered for the preſent to his advantage, the firſt ſort being too far off to give him ſpeedy aſſiſtance, as the other too diſobedient to lend him much aide, that his Generall was conſtrained to take the Field with a very ſmall number; onely the Armie within ſome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98927:7"/>few weeks became increaſed by an addition of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes</hi> Forces, whoſe envie to my Father, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the neere kindred betweene them, had rendred him a moſt mortall enemie.

In this poſture we remained untill ſhe ſent me to be a Suitor to a rich Heire, with hopes againe to raiſe our Houſe to ſome eminency, by obtaining the poſſeſſion of another principality that rightly belonged to the young Lady; but <hi>Tygranes,</hi> as if he had abſolutly ſworne himſelfe an enemy to all that could do good to our family, not only became

                  <p>Mighty King, ſaid he, although your Emperiall Diadems ſeemes to flouriſh with Olive Branches, whilſt the ambition of other Princes make but the Prerogative of their Crownes nouriſh the

Great Sir, ſaid he, as I ſhall not need to trouble you with many parciculars concerning the unhappy paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of my Fathers fortunes, ſince the ſtory I ſuppoſe hath been ſufficiently preſented to your eares by common fame, if not by more exact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, ſo muſt I at this time, not onely give you an account of my own actions, being encouraged thereunto by your Majeſties appearing favours, but alſo doe preſume upon redreſſes according to your power and goodneſſe: to this purpoſe be pleaſed to know, that my name is <hi>Caſſianus</hi> your moſt unfortunate Nephew, being driven from my rights and poſſeſſions in the fruitfull Country of <hi>Iberia,</hi> by the tyrannicall oppreſſions of <hi>Artaxis</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> which hath cauſed me ſince my yeares gave me ability, both to underſtand and proſecute my own affaires, to travel through moſt part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> to ſeeke aſſiſtance amongſt other Princes of my owne ranke; but finding them for

Theſe anſwers quickly carried my endeavours to the Court of <hi>Syria,</hi> where at preſent raignes <hi>Orſames</hi> that mighty King, who after I had alſo preſented unto him my deſires, he ſeemed to wonder why I ſhould make my addreſſes to himſelf or any other Prince in <hi>Aſia,</hi> when you notwithſtanding your power, peace, and tranquillity, appeared to be ſo far from giving me any aide in my neceſſities, that you were not at all ſenſible of my ſufferings; how ever he told me, that if I could yet procure the breach of that amity beweene you and <hi>Artaxis,</hi> whereby ſome conſiderable ſupplies might come from <hi>Lydia,</hi> abounding as he ſaid rather in luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries then in activity, he would preſently declare Warre againſt the <hi>Armenian</hi> King, by which meanes I might come againe into the poſſeſſion of my loſt Rights. Theſe intimations I bring from one powerfull Monarch to another, and ſuch ſupplications my owne neceſſities require me to make, the rather for that not onely your royall blood, hath honoured my birth from my moſt Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Mother, but the ſame worſhip of the Gods are exerciſed both in <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Iberia,</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Euarchus,</hi> after he had fully underſtood with a penſive attentiveneſſe his Nephews requeſt, and entertained him with thoſe complements, and that welcome his condition and alliance merited, he onely for the preſent told him, that as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this conſequence required a judicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, ſo he might be confident of his love and affection, and withall invited him for diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to be a partaker of the <hi>Lydian</hi> paſtime, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing as he ſaid, with his youth and courage, which gave their thoughts for ſome houres ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient imployment.

                     </gap> but the night comming on ſo faſt, the King was not onely forced to put off his unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable meditation untill a more convenient ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but to command the retreat from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull exerciſe to be ſounded: Wherefore ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the youth by the hand, with whoſe perſon and behaviour he ſeemed to be already in love, he placed him by him in his Coach, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98927:11"/>the time with diſcourſes of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, untill they arrived at the Palace, which for it's ſingular beauty deſerves a particular deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The houſe was ſeated upon the banks of the river <hi>Pactoleus,</hi> by whoſe refreſhing ſtreames, the delightfull gardens placed of all ſides, ſeemed to flouriſh with an exact greenneſſe: the portall was formed of white marble, with columns ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitraue freeze and corniſh; on the top it was crowned with a <hi>Cornucopia</hi> in compaſſing an aſure globe, ſupported by little <hi>Cupids</hi> with gilded wings; under which they paſſed through a ſquare Court, ſet round about with excellent Statues of braſſe in <hi>Niches:</hi> the ſtructure it ſelfe was of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Granet ſtone,</hi> ſo interlaced with <hi>Ionick</hi> and <hi>Corinthian</hi> pillars of divers colours, that as it gave the eye a moſt delectable object, ſo it rendred the Edifice much more ſumptuous; At the upper end was a large Taraſe elevated ſix ſteps; upon the ſtaires ſtood <hi>Hiacinthia</hi> the Queen, to give her husband meeting accompanied by the new ſtranger.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Caſſianus</hi> beheld that beauty mixt with a kind of ſweet majeſty, that both aw'd and pleas'd at the ſame time, he addreſt himſelfe to her preſence, like one that intended onely to be <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſuppliant; however the Queen that was ignorant in nothing but pride, with a gentle ſmile, which notwithſtanding for the more grace, put a virmillion bluſh in her faire cheeks, gave him a gracious welcome into <hi>Lydia:</hi> but turning his eye on one ſide, he was ſuddenly ſtruck with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98927:11"/>ſuch an amazement, to behold the Princes <hi>Cloria</hi> the Kings daughter, that he had ſtrife enough with his own paſſions to performe the reſt of thoſe reverences due to her mothers dignity, ſince his thoughts imagined to look upon an earthly deity. She was cloathed in light Taffety for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of the ſeaſon, through which her dainty limbs ſeemed to appeare in admirable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leaving nothing to be hid that hindred the true knowledge of her excellent ſhape, but yet covered thoſe beauties which are encreaſed onely by opinion and deſire. She was crowned with a chaplet of white and red Roſes, not yet fully blown; her haire was combed to the full length and breaded with ribons of the ſame colour, as if arte were ambitious of natures liberty; her ſleeves were open, and lyned with needlework of the ſtory of <hi>Diana</hi> and <hi>Acteon,</hi> wherein the Nymphs with a confuſed baſhfulneſſe; ſeemed to hide themſelves amongſt the ruſhes; and all the reſt of her ſcarce any apparrel was ſo becomming, that either ſhe made it ſo by her perfections, or her perfections could not be fitted by better inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>But the Queen quickly removed <hi>Caſſianus</hi> from that object that began already ſo ſtrongly to charm all his ſenſes, for taking him by the hand, ſhe walked with him many turns about the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſe, whilſt in the mean time he diſcourſed to her his adventures; however now and then he could not chooſe but diſturbe his ſtory, by caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his lookes where the Princes ſtood, though at laſt ſhe ſuddenly ſhot from his ſight like a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98927:12"/>bright ſtarve in the firmament, which made him ſeek her with his eyes to as little purpoſe: After ſome time that the Queen ſeemed ſufficiently to have recreated herſelfe in the aire, ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by an officer of the Court, that the King expected her company in the Parlor.</p>
                  <p>The room was onely divided from the gardens by a partition of bright glaſſe, interwoven with certaine ſilver Terms that afforded a moſt dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable proſpect upon the <hi>Oreng-trees,</hi> and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fountaines: not long after their entrance (in which ſpace the King inſtructed <hi>Caſſianus</hi> in the Maſters of his principall pictures) ſupper was ſerved upon a marble Table without covering, for the more coolneſſe, neere which was a lake of cleare water, where <hi>Neptune</hi> ſate in Majeſty with <hi>Tritons,</hi> that by the artificiall turning of a cock, ſounded their trumpets compoſed of ſhels at the entrance of every courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſſianus</hi> was placed by fortune right over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Cloria,</hi> which not onely gave him ſufficient opportunity to contemplate her beauty, but the contemplation it ſelfe afforded him ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant matter to work upon, that he fed more his ſoule by that delight, then his appetite with the delicious diſhes of the Kings table, and certainly had been abſolutely loſt in that raviſhing le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, if <hi>Euarchus</hi> had not often wakened him by divers queſtions concerning his journey, and the reſt of his adventures in <hi>Armenia,</hi> to make a civil though ſcarce a ſatisfactory anſwer but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as if he eſteemed his eyes bound to the duty, he caſt his look again that way, which occaſioned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98927:12"/>ſtill more diſtractedneſſe in his reply; ſo that the King beleeving his Nephewes travells required a neceſſary reſt, not onely preſently roſe from the Table, but commanded the chiefe Nobility of the Court, to conduct the Prince to his lodging, where he had privacie enough to fulfill the deſires of his curious fancies, which entertained him all the night with little or no ſleep, untill the Kings muſick the next morning ſaluted him with this Ditty.</p>

Yet <hi>Euarchus</hi> mindfull both of his affection to his Nephew, and the proſperity of his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, finding rumours began too frequently to fly about the Court, by reaſon of the violent deſires of many to be imployed in the Warres; one day called unto him an ancient Officer of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, on whoſe wiſdome and fidelity hee moſt relyed in all his waightie Affaires; and leading him into the Garden, where he might both enjoy privacie and recreation, after ſome neceſſary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which ſeemed to uſher in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he uſed theſe words: <hi>Polinex</hi> ſaid he, (for ſo he was called) as I have ever moſt truſted your knowledge and experience, ſo have I never been leſſe confident of your loyaltie and affection, ſince neither as yet hath deceived my expectation when I had moſt occaſion to uſe your ſervice, which deſervedly renders you a worthy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, as I deſire to be a good Prince, that cannot I hope but produce conſequences towards the happy Government of my Kingdomes; however at the preſent, your faithfull advice is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit then ever, ſince expedition and danger can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeparated from thoſe undertakings I am violently preſt unto. You know that lately there is come to my Court, my Nephew <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> a Prince whoſe perſon and merits deſerve at leaſt a kinſmans conſideration, much more his injuries a

                  <p>
                     <hi>Polinex,</hi> after he had with an humble gravity, heard out the Kings diſcourſe, and taken ſome time to conſider the waightineſſe of the Councel, in a diſtinct manner returned this anſwer, wherein he uſed no more eloquence then was neceſſary for the importancy of ſo great a buſineſſe, though Nature and Art had furniſhed him with partes excellent in that kind.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid he, as benefits had from Princes are paſt requitall in a Subject, even like graces received from the Gods, by which we are enabled to doe ſomething; ſo I the unuſefulleſt of your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, though moſt honoured by your goodneſſe, may by the reflection of your luſtre merit the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Councellor, becauſe you have bin plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make me one; but if I ſhould in the leaſt thought prove a Traytor to your glory (as a hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence that ought to bury the remembrance of any good paſt) I did not onely deſerve to bee diſveſted of all your former benefits, but to bee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98927:14"/>condemned to the worſt of puniſhments, ſince your tranſcendent favours have rendered my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects conſiderable: however, if my weakneſſe chance to erre, and not my will, that mercy which makes you reſemble the Gods I muſt challenge; and thus according to your royall command, I freely deliver my opinion. A Warre wiſely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, ought chiefly to be accompanied with two conſiderations; the right of the Quarrell, and the power of the Quarreller; the firſt makes a man a juſt Enemy, the ſecond a prevailing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour; without either of which, certainly a Prince cannot be fortunate, ſince he muſt be an oppreſſor or a loſer, and why your Majeſty ſhould not give your ſelfe the liberty of ſuch a reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, notwithſtanding the preſſing neceſſity of your kinſman, I know no reaſon, ſince your Kingdoms are more to be valued then his Countrey, and your honour then his benefit, though I will not at all diſpute the worth of his perſon. Beſides, you are to conſider with what Prince you are to have the difference, not onely a neighbour that never yet injur'd your right in any thing, but of the contrary one with whom you have ſworne a perfect friendſhip, which is an alliance the heavens have made to be preferred far before humane kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, ſince the one is ſeal'd but with fleſh and blood, as the other hath imprinted it's character in the skies. Againe, for you to proclaime a Warre of blood, before you have demanded peace by a friendly diſputation, were to ſtile you cruell, ſince no violence proceeding from the greateſt ambition ever practiſed ſuch an injuſtice, to put
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98927:14"/>in execution a force to obtaine that which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Enemy you intend to make, will eaſily grant; and as it will be eſteemed more charity and goodneſſe, to perſwade then compell, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the cauſe be abſolutly juſt; ſo if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, you are a double injurer, one way in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning an unlawfull contention without provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; the other, in breaking thoſe tyes that ought to oblige all Princes to an inviolable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. Alſo, you may be pleaſed to conſider your hazard, ſince your owne ſafety is firſt to be valued, whether in honour or proſperity; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your Kingdomes doe in ſome ſort equall <hi>Armenia</hi> in multitude of men and warlike provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, yet in reſpect of the long neglect of Martiall Diſcipline they are rendred as it is to bee feared, wholly incapable of a preſent expedition; and your treaſure, notwithſtanding it be ſufficient to maintaine the expence of your peaceable Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet, it will be found no way able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the charge of a powerfull Army; ſo that whether your people, ſo unaccuſtomed to oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and impatient of ſubjection, from whoſe purſes muſt come the ſupply, (inconſtant by nature to their owne deſires, witneſſe their promiſes late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſame occaſion) wil be brought blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to contribute, without being privie to every ſecret intention, in my judgement is ſcarce a queſtion; and how dangerouſly deſtructive that would prove to any enterprize, when the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude muſt be made acquainted with each ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of State, I leave your Majeſty to judge. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my opinion is, that untill you can provide a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98927:15"/>ſtore out of your owne revenew, without depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether upon the uncertainty of your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bounty, no warlike undertaking can prove glorious or beneficiall, but of the contrary dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and unprofitable: So that all you can do for the preſent, is to ſend an Ambaſſador with reaſons to perſwade, and not a Herald with threatnings to denounce, which in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie will not only give ſatisfaction to your diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Kinſeman, but win time till you be better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
                  <p>This advice extreamely pleaſed the King, who aimed rather at preſent content then future glory, although his courage might pretend to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt honour, not onely for that it tooke away the occaſion of exhauſting his treaſure, but was alſo as he thought, a principall meanes ſtill to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his ſtate in tranquillity, and his government without perturbation. Wherefore parting from <hi>Polinex</hi> with ſuch a ſmile as ſufficiently perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him hee was well ſatisfied with his Councell, ſent preſently for Prince <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> to whom he communicated his determination, which was forthwith to imploy an Amdaſſadour, to demand reaſon of the King of <hi>Armenia.</hi> But however this determination did not much diſcontent <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus,</hi> becauſe it gave him opportunity to remain in <hi>Lydia,</hi> whereby he might the better proſecute his ſecret affections to the faire Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> yet thoſe that violently deſired imployment in the Warres, though it were bought with never ſo much prejudice to the Kings Affaires, extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mutined againſt <hi>Polinex</hi> his Councell, amongſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98927:15"/>which number there was a Nobleman called <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogoras,</hi> one whoſe birth exceeded his wit, as his ambition did his courage; and his fortune not anſwering either, made him much more violent then the reſt, ſince he ſuppoſed if he loſt this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for action, <hi>Euarchus</hi> reſolutions for peace would become more eſtabliſhed; beſides, he hated the Kings perſon, becauſe he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received many Court affronts, procured by his owne factious ſpirit; wherefore he took occaſion by this meanes, not onely to informe the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> that <hi>Euarchus</hi> could not be drawne to make War againſt any of the kindred of <hi>Soroaſters</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> upon what pretence ſoever, but ſecretly poſſeſt all manner of people either with the Kings want of courage or good nature, ſince coldly he was content as he ſaid, to let ſleepe the oppreſſions of his injur'd Nephew without revenge: but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally he blamed the pernitious Councells, as he termed them, of <hi>Polinex,</hi> who ſtrived to rock <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarchus</hi> mind into a lethargie of repoſe, that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone might rule the State with more conveniency towards the particular inriching of his owne Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and the rather were theſe factious ſpeeches dangerous, becauſe the King was reſolved, out of the rules of hoſpitality, not to queſtion any thing that was ſaid in <hi>Caſſianus</hi> behalfe; which within a ſhort ſpace began inſenſibly to penetrate the hearts of the vulgar. <hi>Dimogoras</hi> having a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal intereſt in their affections, not onely becauſe they knew he was not eſteemed at Court, but for that commonly men of leaſt eminent worth have the fortune to gain the opinion of the multitude,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98927:16"/>ſince they hate vertue, becauſe they are reſolved not to follow it. However, <hi>Euarchus</hi> to remedy (the ſweeteſt way he could) theſe growing incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which yet appeared not in full proſpect to divert his Nephewes thoughts from entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcontented Councells, proclaimed a generall hunting of the wild Boare, at which time <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> being ſummoned by the early morning to the delightfull ſport, he found the King ready prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Forreſt, upon the Plaine before the Palace gate, where <hi>Hyachinthea</hi> the Queen, not ſo much pleaſed with the Chaſe as to accompany her Husband, ſoone repaired with the choiceſt Ladies, whoſe dreſſe reſembled the chaſte Goddeſſe <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> in the like exerciſe, onely upon her head ſhe wore a Hat, the more commodiouſly to cover the faire treſſes of her haire, that were imbraced with rowes of rich pearle, ſince no meaner tyes were fit to adorne ſo bountifull a treaſure; and in this poſture they iſſued out, animated by the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſolicitation of the Huntſmen, who ſeemed over ambitious to be in their elements; at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo interpreted by love-ſick <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> who thought all the preperation nothing, ſince <hi>Cloria</hi> the onely Star of his deſires was not to be of the Society, her Mother judging her by much too young for the paſtime. No ſooner was the unhandſome Beaſt diſlodged from his darkſome Habitation, when every perſon well horſt, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhew his owne skill, and his Courſers vigour, whilſt the ſolitary Woods reſounded with the cheerfull noiſe of divers hornes that ſeemed to encourage the Hunters; onely the women com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained

Wherefore riſing from the ſeat where he ſat, and ſnatching up the head, he held it upon the point of the ſpeare in the aire, whilſt the Hounds with open mouthes, ſeemed to beſiege his perſon, untill the Huntſmen themſelves comming into the quarre, were forced to defend him from their rude violence, and in that imployment he continued, while the other almoſt loſt companie, had leiſure to aſſemble, to perfect the triumph for the ſlaughter of that cruell Beaſt, that had done ſo much miſchiefe in the Country, terrifying the common people with the frightfull apprehenſion of his aſpect, who durſt not travell by the places of his habitation, to follow their neceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But not long had the Ladies ſatisfied their curioſities in beholding the dead Boare, though yet at ſome diſtance ſcarce beleeving him ſo in effect, as alſo infinitly commending <hi>Eumenes</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that had in ſingle Combate brought him to his deſtruction, as they underſtood by <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> that had been the eye-witneſſe of the encounter; But the King and Queen in a gentle hand gallop, made towards them through the ſame paſſage that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> had found out in his ſolitary contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, which gave <hi>Eumenes</hi> occaſion, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with his friend Prince <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> to preſent himſelfe before their perſons, not onely offering
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98927:22"/>to the Queen the Boares head as a ſacrifice to her beauty, but deſired humbly to be excuſed that he had unwillingly interrupted their ſport. When <hi>Caſſianus</hi> had certified <hi>Euarchus</hi> fully of all the proceedings in that Combate, wherein he let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing paſſe that concerned his friends honour, and alſo made the King acquainted with his breeding, condition, and Countrey, he ſoone obtained ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for his valiant fact: However, the envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evening comming on, which denyed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of a new Chace, a ceſſation from that ſport was quickly proclaimed by the Kings command, and the rather for that they returned with victory and ſpoile: Wherefore <hi>Euarchus</hi> and <hi>Hiachinthia</hi> taking the two friends into their own Coach, whilſt the skilfull Coach-man made what haſte he could through the rugged way, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Eumenes</hi> not onely the relation of his own travells, but the ſatisfaction of the manner of the government of the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> ſince their revolt from the King of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eumenes</hi> receiving this injunction from the King, however he ſuppoſed, he rather deſired to have his curioſity ſatisfied in his ability, then that his knowledge could any way be inſtructed by his relation, excuſing himſelfe concerning his owne particular adventures, as not worthy His Majeſties attention, he proſecuted this diſcourſe: Truely Sir, ſaid he, it is no ſmall difficulty for a perſon of my meane capacity, to particularize the true cauſes or motives of the firſt revolts in any Kingdome, though you are pleaſed to give me the imployment, ſince as the complaints for the moſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98927:22"/>part are confuſed and uncertaine, more gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned perhaps by the paſſions and fancies of the common people, then grounded upon right and knowledge; ſo of the other ſide, it cannot be denied, but that often times prerogative and power will finde out waies and ſhifts to caſt off the aſperſions, either againſt themſelves or favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites; though I muſt confeſſe both may have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enough, to defend their allegations, before an indifferent auditory, if ſuch a Tribunall could be inſtituted; but that not being poſſible to be had upon earth, moſt commonly ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are onely ended by the ſword; which Fate hath befell the fruitfull Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> though now it be eſtabliſhed in a perfect proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe, the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> naturall Lord of thoſe Countries, having placed a Lady of eminent vertues as ſupream governeſſe for him, both in <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Pamphylia,</hi> whether the people preſuming upon the ſuppoſed weakneſſe of her ſex, joyned with the inconſtancy of their own humours and diſpoſitions; or rather being put on to demand ſomething (though they knew not very well what) that ſeemed to appertain to their ancient priviledges, by the ambition of ſome of the Nobility; (that belike ſeemed not very well ſatisfied) of a ſudden began moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to complaine of the obſtruction of their cuſtomes, as alſo of the cruelty of the lawes made (as they pretended) both againſt their freedome and conſciences; And being tranſported with theſe furious fancies, when the Court leaſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98927:23"/>thought of their diſorders, they run violently to all the chiefe Temples of the City, where I may ſay, they committed many outrages, of neereſt affinity with ſacriledge and rebellion: but the Governeſſes extraordinary mildneſſe and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, not onely quickly aſſwaged all theſe begun miſdemeanours, but readily pardoned their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, though ſhe very well knew, many principall perſons were intereſſed in the occaſion of thoſe Tumults; notwithſtanding ſhe wiſely and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly ſeemed not to take notice of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſuch intimations might create thoſe jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, that probably would again kindle a new fire of diſcontent and apprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>However the Court and Councell of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> having underſtood theſe proceedings, whoſe greatneſſe of Empire and power in command, could brook neither reſiſtance nor diſpute, thought it not agreeing with the honour and dignity of their King (whoſe authority before theſe accidents, ſeemed rather to be adored then contraverted) to ſuffer theſe inſolencies to eſcape, without ſome remarkable ſeverity, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the nobility as the people; preſently deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a huge army for theſe countries, compoſed of the beſt &amp; oldeſt ſouldiers <hi>Aegypt</hi> could produce; And theſe Troops were put under the command of a perſon of the ſame Nation, that better knew how to puniſh facts committed, by a kind of harſh cruelty, then to compoſe differences newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, with mildneſſe and temper; rather imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Phyſicians, which uſe deſperate reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to perfect the body the ſooner, then by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98927:23"/>application to ſave part, for feare the whole ſhould periſh. In ſhort, whoſe experience in the wars was more ancient and glorious, then his nature any way relenting; in ſo much as like a ſtorme comming a farre of, demonſtrated by lightning and thunder, he gave the people cauſe of feare and terrour, before the tempeſt arrived; which cauſed many of them, by the report onely to quit their dwellings; as of the other ſide, not a few of the Noblemen, that were the leaſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of their own loyalty, preſently engaged one another in private counſels. As ſoon as this great Generall arrived, he not onely diſpoſſeſt the Governeſſe her ſelfe of her chiefe authority, by producing a larger commiſſion, but ſeized upon the perſons of many of the Nobility, whoſe lives were publiquely ſacrificed to his fury, whilſt terrour and amazement ſeized the hearts of the common people: Notwithſtanding this rough demeanour, he proclaimed every where, ſhould be maintained by the ſword, untill his own thoughts could become ſatisfied, of the ſubjects entire obedience to his commands.</p>
                  <p>Theſe rigorous and new proceedings, quickly involved the whole Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> in a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling confuſion, as well as in a future rebellion, inſomuch as almoſt all people entertained theſe ſtrange beginnings, as ſad omens, if not preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome tmely reſiſtance, that threatned a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſtruction, as well to their lives as eſtates; when as formerly they held themſelves the freeſt ſubjects of the world, by reaſon of thoſe privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges they had gained, by the indulgent natures
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98927:24"/>of their many good and mercifull Princes.</p>
                  <p>And thus, Sir, I muſt ſay, was the firſt fatall fire kindled in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which ſince hath been aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the powerfull intereſt of moſt of the Potentates in <hi>Aſia:</hi> For as upon theſe pretences the people preſently flew out into open hoſtility, ſo did they call in as many forraigne Princes, as they could to their aſſiſtance, who glad of any occaſion to give bounds to the <hi>Aegyptian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> that then began to ſwell to a vaſt large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in command, readily contributed their beſt endeavours; eſpecially the father of <hi>Orſames</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> in ſo much as the effects ſince have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo much blood and ſlaughter, with other varieties of ſucceſſe and fortune, that many bookes might be amplified with the ſtory; untill the ſucceſſion of command fell to this gallant Duke, that now bears ſway in that Region, who hath been ſo principall an inſtrument of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and preſent flouriſhing condition of the Iſland (being not more valiant in war, then wiſe in peace) that the king of <hi>Aegypt</hi> himſelfe, is not onely reduced at preſent to that ſtate, by reaſon of his powerfull contentions againſt him, both by ſea and land, that he ſeeks peace upon any termes, with a reſignation of all his pretended rights; beſides the people in regard of the Dukes prudent government, with their own induſtry, (who at the beginning of theſe ſtirs were rather poor and contemptible fiſhermen, then approved &amp; credible Merchants) are become now ſo terrible upon the Sea, that by their numerous Veſſels for trading, they fetch home to their own quarters,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98927:24"/>all the riches of the world; the Queen hereupon put a ſtop to <hi>Eumenes</hi> diſcourſe with this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and yet I have heard, ſayd ſhe, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence he can procure from their gratitudes, is onely a bare penſion for his ſupport and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance; neither will they willingly allow him any other Title, then their ſervant; however his valour and conduct in the warres, upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, brings to their aſſiſtance the beſt ſpirits of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as conceiving him moſt worthy to be their maſter in martiall affaires. Tis true Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Eumenes,</hi> I muſt needs confeſſe the people themſelves, although naturally they are no ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being altogether addicted to the induſtry of the ſpade, by which faculty they have performed admirable things, to the wonder of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet are they crafty enough to maintaine their own liberties, and ſuffer the Duke to enjoy no other juriſdiction over them, then what they are content from time to time, to afford him for their beſt commodity and advantage: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is thought, if his ambition were equall to his power, he might make himſelfe abſolute Prince of the Countrey, without contradiction, having the army ſo entirely at his command; as well in regard of many factions amongſt their Governours, as by reaſon of the neceſſity of one head and Governour; eſpecially if they ſhould purchaſe to themſelves peace from the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> who (as I ſaid before) now ſeems with earneſtneſſe to deſire it of them.</p>
                  <p>After the King had a little ſmiled upon the Queen at <hi>Eumenes</hi> diſcourſe, ſo much pretending
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98927:25"/>to the Dukes intereſt and commendation, being himſelfe extreamly perfect in the knowledge of thoſe parts, he began to argue with him in this manner: Although I cannot, ſaid the King, but approve of your obſervations, and much more commend your affectionate retorick in the Dukes behalfe, who no doubt in the generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves as much as you have ſaid, yet I muſt not conclude altogether with you in beliefe, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this eaſie acceſſion to ſoveraignty, though his intentions were directed to thoſe ambitions: for notwithſtanding you may ſee him alwaies attended with glorious and gallant Troops in the field; a proſpect, I muſt confeſſe, that cannot but dazle youthfull or common eyes; yet when it ſhall be conſidered withall, that the common ſouldiers (who for the moſt part are rather carried on to their imployments, by their own private gaine, then by the advancement of their generall) are onely payed by certaine treaſurers appointed by the people, entirely faithfull to their deſignes, that upon the leaſt diſorders may obſtruct or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their wages, either in part or in the whole; it will be a very difficult matter, to unite them abſolutely in the Dukes deſignes againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; eſpecially when it ſhall be alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that moſt of all the Towns in the Iſland, are not onely ſtrong both by nature and art, but are continually guarded by the Burgers themſelves, without having any relation at all to the Generall, and ſo by conſequence are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with proviſions of every fort, in ſo much as the leaſt fort of the Country, is neither to be
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98927:25"/>ſurprized by any manner of ſtratagem, or to be taken without a very long ſiege, which would give the Dukes army without pay, occaſion enough to change their reſolutions in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim; and rather ſeek to betray his perſon, then advance his ambition: Wherefore I hold him to be much a wiſer man, in deſiſting from thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, then in entring upon deſignes, that at the worſt may ruine his poſterity, and at the beſt cannot much mend his condition; ſince at the preſent the people afford him ſo large a penſion for his entertainment, that doth more then equall the revenues of many abſolute Princes of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ranke, which is enjoyed, as I may ſay, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either hazzard or trouble.</p>
                  <p>And however the factions of the people, as you have intimated may ſeem ſomething to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to this probability, yet conſidering in their natures, how much they are addicted to freedome and equality, though ſuch a neceſſity ſhould compell a change, I am moſt confident they would rather call in again their old Prince, then make election of any new; much leſſe the Duke, whom however his birth and Titles are more illuſtrious, yet in their hearts they ranke him as once a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubject with themſelves, to the King of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> And if peace, as you ſay, ſhould be entirely reſtored to that Iſland, the contrary now being a means the more ſtrongly to unite them againſt the common enemy, yet ſuch is their hate to a juriſdiction of that nature, I am perſwaded they would never be brought to that ſubjection, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an abſolute conqueſt and deſolation; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98927:26"/>their not being able, as you have already related to brook it in their lawfull King, under whom they ſeemed to enjoy all manner of felicity and content: Tis true, it is otherwiſe with the ſubjects of <hi>Syria,</hi> who are ſo wedded to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and proſperity of their Prince, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to withdraw their fidelities, by any taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or almoſt oppreſſions whatſoever, though ſometimes their Nobility perhaps, flie out againſt the power and greatneſſe of favourites, who ſeem ſomething to obſcure their intereſt with their Soveraigne, but all diſpoſitions not being alike: As for example, I finde my own ſubjects begin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, to be weary of thoſe happineſſes under a peacefull Monarch, that other kingdomes can but onely hope for, after a long and bloudy expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience: The King at their very words, as if he felt ſomething inwardly at the ſoule, reſted ſilent for a pretty ſpace; and then again, as if he had anew recollected his ſpirits, kiſſing the Queen twice or thrice, he altered the ſubject of his ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcourſe, into another of more variety and delight; which continued them imployed, untill they arrived at the palace gate, where many lighted Torches attended to conduct him and the Queene up the ſtaires. Their ſupper being finiſhed, with no more curious tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, then was convenient for the ſatiſfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the neceſſity of their appetites, ſharpned by their paſt daies exerciſe, a great part of the night was ſpent in dancing with the Ladies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of the delightfull Court of <hi>Lydia;</hi> in which recreation it was <hi>Caſſianus</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:98927:26"/>fortune, to entertaine the beautifull Princes <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> as if the Gods intended him the opportunity; but whether his fancie onely made him believe it, or that really he did utter ſomething of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to her innocent eares; yet ſhe ſeemed no way to be warmed by a lovers flames: in ſo much as poore <hi>Caſſianus</hi> became of a ſudden as frozen as his Miſtreſſes apprehenſions; ſince he too feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuſpected a deniall in that ſuit, which perhaps his own feares would not ſufficiently ſuffer him to diſcover to her underſtanding; And oftentimes too much deſire renders us not onely unfit to act, but uncapable to interpret: but however theſe accidentall paſſages were either executed or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, <hi>Euarchus</hi> and <hi>Hyacinthyas</hi> unexpected retirement for the preſent, gave no more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for a further triall of either; which not onely quickly ſeparated the company, but retired the ſtrangers into their ſeverall chambers: where <hi>Caſſianus</hi> gave his eyes no leiſure at all to reſt, by reaſon of the diſcurteſie of his own Turbulent thoughts, that drove him from one unquiet fancy to another, untill the more charitable morning invited him into ſomething a handſome ſleep: but after two houres time, that alſo was interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by factious <hi>Dimogoras,</hi> who with a certaine kind of ſtorm in his countenance, entred abr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his chamber, which freedome he ever chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged, by reaſon of the confidence he had of his own faithfulneſſe to the Princes deſignes.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Dimogoras</hi> had beſtowed upon the Prince ſome few complements belonging to his dignity, as well as anſwerable to the ſeaſon, he let him
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98927:27"/>know he had ſome diſcourſe of conſequence to impart unto him, if he pleaſed to diſmiſſe his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe being gone, and he invited by the Prince, to ſeat himſelfe upon his bed ſide, for the more conveniency, with a kind of melancholly and diſcontented countenance, accompanied with a more haſtie and rough delivery, he entertained his eares with this language:</p>
                  <p>Although it be moſt true, my Lord, ſaid he, that it is given out by the ſpightfull Court, and ſuffered by the Kings injuſtice, that both my nature and deſires, with a great deale of violence hunt after nothing but contentions, whereby I might come to have ſome eminent imployment in the warres; yet I take all the Gods to witneſſe (who beſt are acquainted with my thoughts) that your entire ſervice is the chiefe motive of my deſigns, grounded alſo upon the conſideration both of the preſent and future honour and glory of our Nation, now almoſt adulterated by eaſe and quiet, though principally betrayed to this lethargie by the pernicious counſels of <hi>Pollinex,</hi> that for his own advantage and ends, flatters the King with the opinion of his conceived proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as if never before the like Prince had raigned in <hi>Lydia;</hi> when as all <hi>Aſia</hi> is ſcandalized at our government; for <hi>Euarchus</hi> by reaſon of this cold newetrality is eſteemed if not an enemy, at leaſt wiſe no friend to any, but his own concernments; and ſo can never expect a faithfull aſſiſtance from other States, if he were compelled by the ſame neceſſity to require their ayd in any of his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98927:27"/>though a little for the preſent he ſeemes to ſwim in all ſucceſſefull glory.</p>
                  <p>In this inchantment you ſee it is not onely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to behold your Rights violated by the violent and (I may ſay) tyrannicall oppreſſion of your cruell enemies, with a moſt quiet if not inſenſible demeanour, notwithſtanding all the tyes of Affection, Kindred, and Religion, but in his owne perſon is wrought in to ſo low a ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and unworthy ingratitude, that he cannot be brought to beſtow the leaſt reward, or ſo much as any countenance upon men of ſpirit, fame, and deſert; witneſſe our ſmall title of honour denyed <hi>Lycius</hi> the brave <hi>Myſſean</hi> Commander, that ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly defended your cauſe againſt the King of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia's</hi> power.</p>
                  <p>This being ſufficiently apprehended in your thoughts, I ſhall a little ſhew my owne condition, that thereby you may the better judge of me and my deſignes; to this purpoſe I muſt tell you, that ever ſince I had ability to draw and handle a Sword, I have ſtill vow'd my endevours to the ſervice of your Family, inſomuch as when a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall was appointed by <hi>Euarchus</hi> Father with a royall Armie, after that unfortunate Defeat in <hi>Meſopotania,</hi> to defend your Mothers Rights; in the Principallitie of <hi>Iberia,</hi> againſt <hi>Tygranes</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I not onely ſtrongly urged the imployment from the State, but accompanied the Souldiers in the Journey, untill we were commanded away by the King; which however hath ſo ſeaſoned my thoughts with the concernments of your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Houſe, that I cannot but continue my Soule
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:98927:28"/>working, a juſt revenge in your hehalfe, according to the many injuries and indignities you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: You muſt now give me leave to come neerer your intereſt for the preſent, neither won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at my intelligence, ſince I doe confidently aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, that there is ſcarce a Court deſigne how private ſoever, but I have knowledge of the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, by reaſon of my kindred and intimation amongſt the chiefeſt of <hi>Euarchus</hi> Councellers.</p>
                  <p>With this aſſurance you muſt know, that not many dayes agoe there is arrived upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Lydia, Anaxia</hi> the old Queene of <hi>Syria,</hi> who being for ſome time beaten at ſea by ſtormes, as at land by tempeſts, procured by her owne reſtleſſe nature, that could not endure to ſit quiet under the ſecurity of her Sonnes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, at laſt is come under the juriſdiction of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> as I believe, with an intention to raiſe as many troubles in this Kingdome, as ſhe hath for ſome yeares paſt in other places.</p>
                  <p>As I cannot deny her to be a Lady of excellent parts, and in her youth of extraordinary beautie, ſo by her birth ſhe is of <hi>Corinthe,</hi> the only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Duke of that magnificent City, which procured her ſuch a liking by <hi>Orſames</hi> Father, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the divorce of his former wife, that with much paſſion he not onely made her Queene of <hi>Syria,</hi> but at his death appointed her the ſole Gardian both of his Sonne and Kingdome. This Office truely ſhe mannaged with diſcretion enough, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the young Kings competent yeares, joyned with the ambition of ſome about his perſon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled her of a ſudden to leave her juriſdiction,

<pb facs="tcp:98927:29"/>imployment that at preſent ſuites perfectly with her appetite, which is to treat of a Match between the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> our Kings Daughter, and <hi>Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi>'s Sonne; and this will no doubt be readily imbraced by <hi>Euarchus,</hi> ſince he may thereby hope the better to curbe his poore Subjects, who he knowes are rather aw'd by his power, then ſatisfied in his affection.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Dimogoras</hi> ſeemed ſtill to proſecute his diſcourſe, yet <hi>Caſſianus</hi> at theſe laſt words of <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Oſiris,</hi> felt himſelfe as it were ſtrook with thunder and lightening; inſomuch as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turning his face to the wall, he ſcarce gave any more eare to what he ſaid: <hi>Dimogoras</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſome more obſervation, that the Prince had not onely changed his poſture, but his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tveneſſe, imagined that the very apprehenſion of <hi>Euarchus</hi> diſaffection to his perſon, in regard his intereſt had beene ſo long neglected, was the ſole reaſon of his ſudden alteration, though the ſecret flames of the Princeſs <hi>Clorias</hi> beautie, was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occaſion of his preſent diſtemper, conſidering the ſmall probability was left him to obtaine his deſire, now a Match of ſuch ſplendor was offered to her choice.</p>
                  <p>After <hi>Dimogoras</hi> had expected ſomething lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger what the Prince would doe, he began this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; As I cannot blame your nature much, ſaid he, to be troubled conſidering the cunning diverſions of your Uncle <hi>Euarchus,</hi> whom as I may ſay, ſeekes any thing in a manner, before your good and benefit, ſo of the other ſide it doth not become a Prince of your birth and extraction,

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98927:30"/>hold of any occaſion, whereby this new intended alliance between the Crownes of <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> may be blaſted in the bud, before it come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any mature ripeneſſe.</p>
                  <p>As he was further proceeding in theſe exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Government, they were both interrupted by a Meſſenger from the King, not onely to know how the Prince had reſted the night paſt after his dayes ſport in hunting, but withall to deſire his company in a ceremonious courtſhip, hee intended in perſon to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon the old Queen of <hi>Syria</hi> his Wives Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though before the Officer could be ſent for into the Princes Chamber, <hi>Dimogoras</hi> ſuddenly tooke his leave.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Caſſianus</hi> had humbly returned his thanks to the King, for his favour in inquiring (as hee ſaid) any way after his concernments, he told the Meſſenger, that however he could not be very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of his own danger, yet he muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine a little of his indiſpoſition, which he feared would hinder him from rendering His Majeſtie that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice he commanded, eſpecially ſince the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was neceſſarily to be performed in ſo great an aſſembly; rather his intentions were for ſome few dayes to keepe his Chamber, as he ſaid, to try whether that retirement would in any kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to his amendment, ſince hee found his thoughts oppreſt by melancholy fancies.</p>
                  <p>This quickly gave occaſion to moſt of the Court to viſit him, yet at thoſe times when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>O <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> ſaid he, to what dangerous rocks have thy fortunes led thee, not to be relieved, but by an inhoſpitable compliance, with thoſe that perhaps more for their own ambition, then thy good, endeavour thy unkles ruine? O gentle <hi>Cloria,</hi> is it poſſible that theſe thoughts in thy ſervants breaſt, can be any more concealed from thy knowledge, then from the Gods divineſt Oracle? what greater indignity can be offered to the heavens, then to harbour in one heart, both love and treaſon, at the ſame time? conſider, O unworthy <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> with what affectionate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations <hi>Euarchus</hi> hath hitherunto entertained all thy concernments, which hath produced effects already, to the ſending of an Embaſſadour to the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> upon whoſe return, and not before, thou art to expect thy doom; and for this pretended love between <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Oſiris,</hi> perhaps the report is onely a bare fancy, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more upon diſtaſtefull ſuſpition, then upon authenticall information, ſince the old Queen of <hi>Syrias</hi> neceſſities, gave her reaſon enough, to ſeek both retirement and reception, without any other deſigne whatſoever: nay further it may very probably be ſuppoſed, that <hi>Dimogoras</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt or ſpleen, may adminiſter occaſions both of too much jealouſie, and over haſty action; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> be not thou ignobly the chiefe inſtrument of <hi>Dimogoras</hi> malice, and the onely

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98927:35"/>to be the inheritrix of my fortune; whoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as I hope, rather then my ſubſtance, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured her two worthy ſuitors, of ſo juſt an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in her eye, that though ſhe be not at all ambitious of a choice, it being onely my preſſing care to ſee her married before I die; ſhe is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to marry one of them: however, ſhe is reſolved not to make the election, nor I, becauſe we are unwilling to hazzard a faction in that quiet courſe we intend to continue; Wherefore it was decreed by the common conſent of all, that the firſt ſtranger we met ſhould be the decider of the difference, ſince this is lhe laſt day prefixt, by a certaine raſh oath I made to ſee her Nuptials performed; ſo that by this means we take away all occaſions of partiality, by making fortune the Judge, for that both have ſworne to ſtand to the arbitration, without mutiny or diſturbance, and willingly aſſiſt in the intended ceremonies, which are preſently to be performed by a holy Prieſt in a little Chappell within the Forreſt; ſo that, if you pleaſe to take upon you this office, you will not onely afford us a perpetuall obligation, but I ſhall prepare my ſelfe inſtantly to inform you of the qualities and condition of the wooers, who are in yonder troop, that ſtill as you ſee, doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the iſſue of my deſire.</p>

                     <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> after he had for ſome time dwelt upon the prettineſſe of the contention, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be a courteous Judge in the love quarrell, with a deep ſigh, reflecting upon his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, which this difference ſeemed to touch, returned him this anſwer: Reverend

                  <p>The two contenders, ſaid he, or rather love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivals, have for ſome yeeres pretended to my daughter <hi>Mantuina,</hi> a young mayd, whoſe baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe hath kept her back from entertaining either of their affections, although their perſons and qualities may challenge an exact beauty, much more the fortune of a ſtrangers childe; but I that rather looke upon the content of poſterity, to fortifie me in this courſe of life, I have now taken on me, ſince I have ſmall hopes to returne again into my own Countrey, being kept from thence by the unjuſt power of my mortall enemy, a ſtory too long at this time to relate; although I am accuſtomed to make known my oppreſſions to moſt paſſengers that viſit theſe parts, being violently ambitious to have her beſtowed, leſt

But to come to the point: theſe two contenders, the one is called <hi>Fridius,</hi> the other <hi>Navarinus;</hi> the firſt a Shepherd by extraction, though his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſors left him well enough to become a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; which hath alſo inflamed his mind with aſpiring thoughts, ſcarce to be contained within the bounds of rurall delights; the other a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man born, but wanting means, hath ſubſcribed his aimes onely within the limits of a Countrey life, and in all probability is likely ſo to continue: which two in perſon are to plead their cauſes, before you their deſigned Judge; wherein, each is to ſpeak what he can for his own advantage, to procure your Arbitration favourable, whereby he may become the deſired husband of my daughter <hi>Mantuina,</hi> ſitting upon yonder riſing bank, the prepared Tribunall of this controverſie,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:98927:36"/>to which purpoſe our company attend our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> although he was moſt willing to have enquired further of the Forreſters condition and adventures, yet finding the occaſion could not admit of any delay, contented himſelfe onely with obeying his deſire, which led them both to the expecting Troop; where having ſaluted every one in particular, they marched to the little hill, and ſeated themſelves after this manner; Firſt, the intended bride was placed uppermoſt, clothed in a green gown, with a chaplet of flowers upon her head, carrying another garland in her hand to crown the Conqueror, accompanied by <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> the elected Judge; whilſt the two pleaders ſtood of both ſides, the one in the habit of a Gentleman, as the other apparelled like a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard; and when ſilence was three times proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by a Cryer, <hi>Fridius,</hi> who ſeemed to have the prerogative firſt to ſpeak, began in this ſort to open his cauſe: Moſt worthy Arbitrator, ſaid he, as I eſteem your ſentence the greateſt that can befall me, ſince it muſt determine my chiefeſt happineſſe; ſo of the other ſide, I cannot but be moſt confident of the ſucceſſe, having ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute a right in my pretenſion; though I will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe an equality of affection and proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for 'tis apparent to all the auditory, that from a mean condition, I have created in my ſelfe a Princes ſoule, tending to the higheſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, by which I have endeavoured to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe my own fate; whilſt the life of my adverſary promiſeth ſo little poſſibility of advancement,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98927:37"/>that he hath pulled down his thoughts below his birth, to give way to contempt, making himſelfe leſſe then nature intended him, like fire buried in the Cinders, wanting agitation and effect, whereas the property of the flame ſhould aſpire: or rather reſembling a cow'd Lyon, for want of action ſo proves a ſcorne to other beaſts; for 'tis not a Lyons skin, but his heart, that ought to render him formidable. If the faire <hi>Mantuina</hi> be given to me, ſaid he, ſhe ſhall (in all likelihood) poſſeſſe riches and power, the two eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of greatneſſe; and be, as it were, every day in a Lottery, ready when fortune will, to be exalted to the higheſt Throne of honour by new attempts; whereas, being wife to my adverſary, ſhe can never hope for more then ſhe hath; ſcarce be aſſured of protection in what ſhe now enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. All things endued with life, looke upward, as he affirmed; when thoſe that are mortified, fall alwaies downward, to their proper center, onely fit to be trod upon: 'tis ambition, ſaid he, that warmes the blood, and renders it Noble, whereas ſloth and want of deſire cauſeth obſtructions, which hinder glory, ſince the great Monarchs of the world could not have purchaſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fame or Empire, if they had not advanced their thoughts beyond their preſent condition. And laſt of all, he pretended 'twas the nature of beaſts onely to preſerve what they had, but of man to ſeek what he had not; and for theſe reaſons he deſired the faire <hi>Mantuina</hi> of the Judge.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Fridius</hi> had ended, <hi>Navarinus</hi> with no
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98927:37"/>leſs affection to the beauteous <hi>Mantuina,</hi> but with more modeſtie ſtood forth to plead his cauſe, and ſaid; that although he could not deny but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his neceſſitie, he had ſuited his minde to his abilitie, yet he held himſelfe as deſerving as his adverſarie, for 'twas not wealth as hee ſaid, but vertue that renders a man truely noble, which conſiſted more in tempering of ambition, then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently aiming at honours, ſince ſmiling proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was but the act of fortune, and a forced ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, the true marke of fortitude; nor did his moderation, as he ſaid, hinder the acceptance of preferment when conveniently it may bee had but taught him the better how to uſe it when it was obtained; for that man muſt needs be more happie that can content himſelfe with any thing, then hee that could bee ſatisfied with no thing. Courage, ſaid he, never ſhewes it ſelfe better, then in over-comming ones own paſſions, nor is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall povertie a derogation, when it is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a ſupine neglect, or a wilfull guilt, but rather a magnanimitie, when it can be borne with patience. A Diamond loſeth not it's eſteeme for being ſet in Horne, or the Sun his influence becauſe often obſcured by accidentall Clouds. A King is a King, ſaid he, although he doe not alwayes weare the Crowne; and for the faire <hi>Mantuina,</hi> he alledged was likelier to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his affections with felicitie that ſought a unitie in the loweſt courſe of life, rather then his rivalls who could be in love with none, and he that is prepared to encounter with adverſitie, knowes beſt how to uſe proſperitie: however,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98927:38"/>ſaid he, it is a higher act of glorie to refuſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then to enjoy it; and for theſe reaſons he claimed the prerogative in his Plea, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the beauteous Bride for his reward.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> had conſidered the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and natures of the lovers, he briefly deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his judgement in theſe words, not willing too long to protract the deſigned Nuptialls: <hi>Fridius,</hi> he ſaid, had ſhewed more ambition, <hi>Navarinus</hi> the greater temper; the one might obtaine the higher honour, but the other the longer ſecuritie; glory ſeemed to attend the actions of <hi>Fridius,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the humilitie of <hi>Navarinus;</hi> the one promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed more hope, the other leſſe feare; the one was endued with a Princes ſoule, which of neceſſitie muſt put him on to dangerous and hazardable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, the other more reſembling a Lover was likelieſt to continue the unitie of affections with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeparation; <hi>Fridius</hi> was fitter to be a Monarch, but <hi>Navarinus</hi> to become a Husband; wherefore he judged the beauteous <hi>Mantuina</hi> to the latter for a Wife, and the Crowne ſhe carried in her hand to the former as a Conqueror, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pleaſed the whole Aſſembly, onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented <hi>Fridius</hi> could not be perſwaded to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at the intended Ceremonie; alledging, that ſince he had loſt his Bride in <hi>Venus</hi> quarrell, hee would endeavour to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:98927:38"/>
                  <p>But however, this abrupt department of <hi>Fridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> diſpleaſed the joyfull troope, yet they reſolved to proſecute their intentions, and to that purpoſe inſtantly roſe from their ſeates, and in an orderly proceſſion directed their courſe towards <hi>Hymens</hi> Temple, not farre off, built of white Marble, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within a <hi>Cypres</hi> Grove, where the Prieſt attended to performe his Office, clothed in a ſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron Robe; who taking lovely <hi>Mantuina</hi> by the hand, after having a little inſtructed her concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning her dutie, he led her to the high Altar, where ſhe was ſolemnly eſpouſed to joyfull <hi>Navarinus,</hi> whilſt in the meane time the roſes of her faire Cheekes ſeemed to get the abſolute victorie over the pure Jvorie of her face; which being finiſhed, the reſt of the day was ſpent in ſuch entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as were fit for the ſeaſon, where the Muſes ſeemed to have a principall prerogative.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Caſſianus</hi> not long contented with thoſe ſports, ſince he was in a manner wearie of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſoone retired into a ſolitarie walke within the Woods, hoping to enjoy in contemplation ſome part of thoſe pleaſures that the two Lovers expected; where he had not remained ſcarce a quarter of an houre, croſſing his armes, and often caſting up his ſorrowfull eyes to heaven, as if from thence he onely attended reliefe, but he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the old Prieſt with this ſalutation, who belike had noted ſome ſtormes in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>

                     <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſeeing himſelfe ſaluted in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the reverend Prieſt, was not onely forced to leave his ſad contemplation, but returned him this courteous anſwer: Truely Father, ſaid he, as my years might pretend verie well to the delights of youthfull companie, yet being ſo happy as to enjoy yours, I ſhall think I have changed much for the better, ſince I may gaine double, both by inſtruction and example.</p>
                  <p>That ſaid the Prieſt, will be according to the impreſſions you are inclinable to receive, and the ability of me that ſhould informe; but as for the firſt, as I cannot any way doubt, ſince your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity hath been ſufficiently demonſtrated in your judgement upon the late controveſie; ſo of the other ſide, concerning the latter, I may make ſome queſtion, whether you are not more able to teach then be inſtructed by my diſcourſe: however, it being my practiſe and office to ſpeake to the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring world, of their obligation to their Creator, I ſhall apply my ſelfe willingly to that ſubject up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occaſion you ſhall give.</p>
                  <p>Of which number ſaid <hi>Caſſianus</hi> I deſire to be one, if you can thinke your words will not be loſt upon ſo ignorant a perſon as my ſelfe, ſince many will not be perſwaded, that either there is a God at all, or that that Divine Power hath any regard of man, for that he ſuffers often times intollerable injuſtices to proſper without puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid the Prieſt, as I will not diſpute the

                  <p>I grant, ſaid <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> a ſupream Maker, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and an infinite Power, that firſt created, and now regulates the diſorderly rage, or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increaſe of naturall things, which elſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, muſt at laſt multiply, to almoſt an infinite maſſe, not to be contained within the worlds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe; but whether this immenſe eſſence imploy it ſelfe in ſo low a conſideration, as to thinke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us and our affaires muſt reſt a queſtion.</p>

But after he had a little dryed his faire eyes with a handkirchieffe he care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſely held it in his hand, he told him his name was <hi>Phalarius,</hi> an unfortunate Couſin of <hi>Alciana,</hi> ſince her late retirement into a Cloyſter, had left him to the world to ſeeke entertainment in his ſervice after having been robb'd and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by certain Theeves. <hi>Oreſtes</hi> hearing the name of his almoſt forgotten <hi>Alciana,</hi> ſeemed ſuddenly ſtrucken with ſome fatall Omen that accus'd him of perjurie and ingratitude, for which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly he merited to be puniſhed; wherefore he ſeated himſelf upon a bench in thoſe walks, with his armes folded one within another, as if hee meant to weave his thoughts an intricate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of diſcontent, his eyes being caſt up to Heaven, as it were to penetrate the very boſome of the Gods, to be informed of the depth of his offence; Thus he continued glaſing his ſight all the while with the troubled water of his ſorrowfull teares, untill the youth himſelfe with the ſadneſſe of his contemplation, could not chuſe but accompanie his paſſion with a few di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled drops of Criſtall from his owne beautifull eyes, and withall by way of interruption told him, that although he intended his preferment in his ſuite, yet he was not ſo unmannerly, as to procure his vexation thereby; but rather if he thought his unworthy ſervice, might prove any inconvenience to his more glorious imployments,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98927:49"/>he would moſt willing notwithſtanding his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>womans kinde recommendation (whom he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived had had ſome intereſt in his breaſt) deſiſt from further proſecuting his intention, how pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ſoever it might prove to his unfortunate condition.

                     <hi>Dion</hi> had no need of any Counſell at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to avoid theſe extravagant intemperances; however, with reſpect enough he took his leave, ſince his wiſdome thought it better to temper his paſſion, the provoke his choler; &amp; yet inſtantly he carried the newes to <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> with the additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo of his opinion; that certainly it was the frequent converſation of the newly entertained Kinſman to <hi>Alciana,</hi> that altered the reſolution of <hi>Oreſtes. Philoſtros</hi> conſidering this ſtrange and ſudden change, could not chuſe but be of the ſame
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98927:51"/>beliefe, and therefore called a Councell of his owne private friends, wherein after ſome conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with the approbation of the King, command was given to an Officer of the Court, with a ſtrong guard to repaire the next morning to the Princes Lodgings, there by force to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate him from his young Favorite, and then to convey his perſon to ſome place of leſſe liberty, where again he might be treated withall about his former promiſe; a judgement given as might be thought againſt all morality and pitty; but the ſupport of a Crown will not be regulated by any compaſſion; tears being onely fit for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a penitent, no way becoming the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an unthroned King, whoſe dazeling glory muſt not behold the darke misfortune of any other condition. This reſolution, I ſay, was put in execution with all expedition and vigour; for the Captaine of the guard, a man of a rough nature, having received his commiſſion, at the time appointed went up into the chamber of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> and finding him a bed, though his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſervant <hi>Phalarius</hi> was newly riſen from the warm ſides of his deare Maſter, where he had repoſed the night paſt; The Officer in a cold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement ſhewed him the ſtrict commiſſion of the King his brother, deſiring him without reſiſtance or delay he would prepare himſelfe to an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute obedience, which elſe might turn to his greater prejudice. But <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> not taken with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſorrow, though he too much apprehended the injury, preſently flew out of his bed, like ſome furious wild beaſt, that feared to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98927:51"/>of that prey, which his own hunger had lately procuced; and ſo ſeized upon his naked Sword that lay neere him on the Table, vowing to make that weapon the inſtrument of his juſt revenge, if he laid the leaſt finger upon his deare <hi>Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> with intention to ſeparate him from his ſight and converſation. The Captaine, whoſe providence had before placed the guard at the ſtaires foot, to be ready at his command if there were occaſion, ſuddenly called them to his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, who with all violence obeying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, in an inſtant incompaſſed <hi>Oreſtes</hi> about, neither regarding his perſon, nor having reſpect to his naked condition, whilſt in the mean time poore <hi>Phalarius</hi> altogether diſtracted, between love and feare, flew with all his power amongſt the coufuſed weapons to defend <hi>Oreſtes</hi> by his own hazzard, from the threatning and appearing danger, where preſently he received a cruell wound in his tender ſides, which ſoon diſcovered it ſelfe by his ſudden ſinking to the ground, ready to pay his laſt duty to nature, as his beſt blood for a ranſome to redeem his Maſter from his captivity. But <hi>Oreſtes</hi> notwithſtanding was preſently ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and led away out of his fayling ſight; which <hi>Phalarius</hi> beholding, more bemoned then his own approaching deſtruction, blaming rather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of the mercileſſe Guard for oppreſſing <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> then for killing him.</p>

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98927:52"/>himſelfe in the action; by which means he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed he might become not onely the abſolute maſter of them both, but have another intereſt in the ſucceſſion of the Crown, if <hi>Orſames</hi> ſhould die without children; and the fates ſeemed to favour his purpoſe, for at the ſame time there lived at the Court a young Lady called <hi>Orbella,</hi> ſiſters daughter to <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> whoſe beauty and eſtimation appeared in a manner to be paralels, for that her Uncles authority did but give her the one, as liberall nature had beſtowed upon her the other; and both made way for the Princes Courtſhip, ſince, as he thought, it was the duty of every youthfull ſpirit, to make love when the occaſion was offered: ſo he believed his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, placed upon ſuch an intereſt, was a ſubject could not but pleaſe <hi>Philoſtros</hi> in a high kind, who now began to become his new maſter, for that his own inconſtancy had made him forget his old miſtreſſe. But however, witty <hi>Orbella,</hi> as well encouraged by her own excellent parts, as coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled by her uncles admirable wiſdome, received his addreſſes rather with a civill careleſneſſe, then by a paſſionate acceptance, ſhewing in all her entertainments, as ſhe knew him to be the Kings brother, that commanded from her a reverence due to his perſon, ſo ſhe was in a manner certain of her own vertues that obliged her to keep his love at a diſtance: however, to pluck more eyes upon her ſelfe, ſhe would daily adorne her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall handſomneſſe with ſome quaint faſhion, which her authority ſoon made a pattern to other Ladies of leſſe eſtimation; by this means inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98927:53"/>covertly the Prince might be more deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with her beauty and handſomeneſſe; ſince variety is the moſt pleaſing object of humane ſenſe; and the rather, when he ſhould ſee every one admired her perfections; As, I ſay, by theſe pretty cunnings <hi>Oreſtes</hi> at laſt became abſolutely in love, whereas his firſt thoughts perhaps were onely to have a Miſtris to court, ſince it was eſteemed the chiefe buſineſſe of the place, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe themſelves with ſuch imployments.</p>
                  <p>And thus inconſtant <hi>Oreſtes</hi> being again engaged in a new labyrinth, <hi>Orbella</hi> plaid with his paſſions to her own commodity, according to her Uncles politick directions; ſometimes inticing his love to a ſtronger confirmation by a multitude of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented oathes; and then again would bring him back into a kind of deſpaire by her ſeeming neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of all his proteſtation, telling him oftentimes in careleſſe ſmiles of his late Miſtris <hi>Alciana,</hi> who could not, as ſhe ſaid, but claim ſome prerogative in his affection, ſince not long agoe he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch violence in her behalfe, in ſo much as he was ready rather to have loſt his brother, and the whole Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> then to be withdrawn from the conſtancy of his profeſſion.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98927:57"/>thoughts, what anſwer he ſhould make to the challenge, and faine hee would have flattered himſelfe with reaſons in the behalfe of his approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching marriage, to have denied or avoided the combat, being ſtung with the ſharpneſſe of the injury he had done to the faire <hi>Alciana:</hi> but his honour, as he believed, called him to a more noble reſolution, eſpecially ſince the ſummons was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him before the eyes of all the brave ſpirits of <hi>Syria,</hi> who would have been glad of his leaſt ſhew of want of courage, ſince their ambitions could not chuſe but envie the dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſo much out-ſhined theirs; wherefore, in a little ſpace, he came out from his ſecret chamber with this anſwer, that although the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing diſtance of their qualities might ſerve as a ſufficient priviledge to make him deny what was ſo raſhly demanded, yet his own eminent courage, as he ſaid, could not diſpence with the reaſon; and therefore was determined to meet his unknown enemy at the time appointed, where he made no doubt but to puniſh him for his bold attempt; and ſo conducting the little Virgin ſome way out of the bounds of his own lodgings, with order ſhe ſhould be ſafely guarded through the Army, returned to make preparation for the appointed combate; where long he had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, but the King came in perſon to chide his brother for undertaking ſo deſperate an attempt without his licence; and withall laying his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent commands upon him, not to proceed further in the execution.</p>
                  <p>But theſe blaſts were too weake to ſhake the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98927:57"/>ſetled reſolutions of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> who choſe rather to die, ſighting with an unknown enemy, then live diſgrac'd among his intimate friends; ſo that, falling down upon his knees before his brother, he deſired him, either to ſuffer him to vindicate his own honour, ſince he had undertaken the combat, or he himſelfe would be the author of his own deſtruction, to let the world ſee he was no coward; which at laſt forced the King to give way to his paſſions, though <hi>Philoſtros</hi> was very ſorry to hazzard his Neeces happineſs in ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a contention.</p>
                  <p>Although <hi>Oreſtes</hi> in heat of blood had conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as I may ſay, raſhly to fight with one whoſe name was not ſo much as known, however he was ſuppoſed to be ſome Prince of <hi>Alciana's</hi> kindred; yet being retired privately into his own ſecret Cabinet, and the dead of the night raiſing fancies in his fearfull imagination, began to expoſtulate with himſelfe after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible the Gods can ſuffer me to ſcape unpuniſhed for thoſe injuries I have done to the more then wronged <hi>Alciana?</hi> much leſſe can I hope for victory in this unjuſt combat; can her ſweet ſoule look down from the skies with any eye of forgiveneſſe, when ſhe ſhall behold me ſhedding more blood of her Noble Family? is it not ſufficient that ſhe already hath made her ſelfe an innocent ſacrifice to redeem part of my wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe; but I muſt with new ſlaughter diſquiet the reſt ſhe now deſervedly enjoyes in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens? O rather let me die by mine own accurſed hand, wherein I ſhall perform an act of juſtice,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98927:58"/>ſince I am onely he that hath offended; then hazzard the death of one who brings with him as little guilt as the dead <hi>Alciana.</hi> No, no, I will not be a mortall enemy to him that profeſſeth ſo abſolute a friendſhip to my deare Love; but rather confeſſe my ſelfe twice overcome, both by his goodneſſe and valour, ſo ſhall I appeare to the world more juſt, though leſſe fortunate: And for <hi>Orbella,</hi> with all her beauties and honours, I ſhall return again to her great Uncle, who can give her not onely protection, but dignity; Whilſt I will again wed my ſelfe to dead <hi>Alciana.</hi> Theſe were the imaginations that entertained the thoughts of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> during the ſolitary ſeaſon of the night, untill the chearfull morning not only gave his mind ſome courage, but brought into his chamber the gallant Commanders of his brothers Army; who breathed nothing into his ſad ſoule but inflamed deſire, and certain victory, that again ſomething ſetled his deſpairing thoughts: ſo that preſently he gave order for his Armes; and whilſt hee was beholding divers of ſundry ſorts, <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> accompanied with many Officers of the Court, deſired to ſpeak a word privately with him; and when all were retired but they two, he told him it was his brothers pleaſure, and his own advice, that he proceeded no further in this combat, unleſſe his adverſary would diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his name, ſince it was judged an indignity to the Crown of <hi>Syria,</hi> for him to hazzard his perſon againſt an obſcure enemy; to which the Prince haſtily anſwered, withall his heart, ſo he would again receive the protection of his Neece
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98927:58"/>
                     <hi>Orbella,</hi> and his brother ſuffer him to retire into ſome obſcure place, where he might continually bewaile his injury done to the dead <hi>Alciana.</hi> This anſwer you may be ſure was a ſufficient bridle to detaine the Counſels of <hi>Philoſtros</hi> from more perſwading <hi>Orſames</hi> againſt the combate; ſince the iſſue as he believed would either pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the glorious marriage of his kinſwoman, or the ſudden and honourable death of <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> whereby he ſhould be ſecured by his friendſhip, or out of feare of his inconſtancy.</p>
                  <p>The time being come for the meeting of the two Champions, <hi>Oreſtes</hi> was mounted upon a pyde horſe, which very lively repreſented either the changeableneſſe of his diſpoſition, or the variableneſſe of his fortune. His Armour was light skie-colour, painted over with an artificiall ſhade that was procured by the Sunnes eclipſe. His Capariſons were cut into the form of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Phenix, the Saddle forming the body as the two wings figured out the ſides, which were compoſed of ſeverall coloured feathers, ſo that the crupper making the taile, the whole bird ſeemed to flie as the horſe moved, bearing the armed Knight in the ayre; and the raines of the bridle being neatly contrived into the likeneſs of flames, as it were kindled from the bit (contrived of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall reſembling fire) ſeemed to aſpire upwards with a conſuming intention. In his ſhield was painted a ſhip toſt upon a ſtormy Sea, only ſet forth with this Motto, <hi>Still uncertain.</hi> But ſcarce had he entred the Liſt, when at the other end appeared his adverſary in a white Armour, ſet forth with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:98927:59"/>the ſtory of <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Ariadne;</hi> the ornaments that covered his horſe were made into the form of a Cypres grove: for his device he bore the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Dido</hi> Queen of <hi>Carthage,</hi> crowned with a Willow garland, without any Motto at all, but her name: ſix ſeeming Virgins carried thoſe ſtaves hee meant to imploy in the encounter, which not onely gave a delectable, but alſo a ſad aſpect to the whole company, ſince by the ſight, both the innocency and injury of <hi>Alciana</hi> was deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Oreſtes</hi> being taken with a new apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion farre above the other Spectators, before he began his courſe, in a ſoft trot rid towards his prepared enemy; who contrariwiſe ſeeing him coming, not having any mind to entertaine his addreſſes, retired almoſt as faſt back; but finding his importunity was not ſo eaſily to be avoided, ſent one of his little meſſengers to tell him, that If his intention was to uſe words before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; he found not his diſpoſition any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable for diſcourſe; wherefore deſired him with courage to ſpeak onely the language of the Sword, which, of the two, was more proper for the ſeaſon. <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> having received this ſharpe reply, and being ſummoned by the Trumpets to the encounter, quickly made his ſpurs teach his horſe his duty, and in the courſe carried himſelfe with ſo much force and dexterity, that at the firſt courſe he bore his adverſary to the ground with the point of his Lance, who had either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately or unskilfully miſt his reſt; yet the Knight appearing aſhamed at the fall, preſently
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98927:59"/>ſtarted up, and with a kind of flouriſhing bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, drew out his Sword, telling him (though his much halting ſhewed his courage was better then his perſon,) that notwithſtanding the Gods flattered him with a ſeeming advantage, yet he ſhould quickly finde by the ſharpneſſe of his wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that his diſſembling Fates did but ſmile him into deſtruction; and although he were on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and his ſelfe on foot, that inequality ſhould not defend him from the ſpeedy puniſhment he merited, according to the requeſt of dying <hi>Alciana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truely, ſaid <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> as I am extreamly unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to entertain the quarrell any further upon theſe termes; ſo of the other ſide, I could be very well content to have laid down my own life as a ranſome to have redeemed hers, by much more innocent. O falſe man, ſaid the Knight, doſt thou believe I can be won by thy diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to abſtaine from a juſt revenge, ſince thou hadſt ſo much cruelty to torment her for onely loving thee; no traytor, ſaid he, I hope the Gods are more righteous then to ſuffer poor <hi>Alciana's</hi> wrongs to goe unpuniſhed, and thy wicked ſelfe live proſperouſly, triumphing over her deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which would be an example too pernicious, whereby the deceived world might be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the like crimes? I confeſſe my fault, ſaid <hi>Oreſtes,</hi> to the faire, vertuous, and injured <hi>Alciana,</hi> ſo the combate may be left off bearing that title. Canſt thou think, ſaid the Knight, thy coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe ſhall buy off the deſerved reward of thy villanies? be aſſured it ſhall not upon any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Which the Prince alſo perceiving, deſired him not obſtinately to continue his own enemy, when his ſeeming adverſary ſo much coveted his good; eſpecially, as he ſaid, ſince the quarrell was not perſonall, but accidentall, containing an others right, who could not be ſatisfied in the conqueſt; and with that courteouſly retired, with an intention to give him not onely breath, but redemption: yet had he ſcarce ſpoke the words, but the Knight with overmuch bleeding fell down in a ſound; which cauſed <hi>Oreſtes</hi> to flie to him with the wings of pitty: wherefore pulling off his Helmet, to give him ſome refreſhing ayre, he ſuddenly diſcovered the countenance of his once dearly beloved ſervant <hi>Phalarius,</hi> thought
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98927:60"/>formerly to be ſlain in his defence: Truely, this was a ſight ſo much beyond his expectation, that he ſtood like one wholly converted into the dead image of ſorrow, being confounded ſo intirely with amazed griefe, that it took from him all effects of compaſſion, not ſtirring from the place where he ſtood, but with his eyes onely, to give redreſſe to that misfortune, which his unwilling hands had occaſioned; and therefore ſuffered the poore youth to lie ſtill, weltring in his own blood, untill the King and ſome of the reſt of the company came in to congratulate his victory.

Wherefore, the better to continue his thought in theſe delights, he ſold ſome few of his ſmaller Jewels, to furniſh himſelfe for a Forreſters life; and alſo cut away much of his beautifull haire, to render his perſon more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the woods; beſides his felicity ſeemed to increaſe, not onely by the ſolitary converſation with the noble huntſman, but alſo by the more knowing inſtruction of the holy Prieſt, which totally baniſht out of his remembrance at laſt, the whole repreſentation of <hi>Clorias</hi> excellencies; In proſecution of this intention, one gentle mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning not being at all threatned by a lowring sky, <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> accompanied only by his own thoughts, that ſeemed altogether innocent, leading in his hand a dainty couple of Greyhounds, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for any chaſe that ſhould accidentally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelfe to his view, iſſued out into the green and flouriſhing Forreſt, where long he had not entertained his expectation with the hopes of diſcovery of ſome beaſt, that might breath his nimble dogs; but he perceived a Knight armed lying upon the ground, under the large protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of an old Oake, whilſt his Lance reſted by the ſide of the tree.

                  <p>Can <hi>Caſſianus</hi> think that any diſſimulation, is of force to hinder the effects and power of perfect friendſhip, which hath eyes beyond the ſollidſt obſtacle? no, no, <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> ſaid he, make a true confeſſion of your fault, that you may receive ſpeedy ſatisfaction.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98927:68"/>did of the contrary comply wholly with all the factious of <hi>Lydia;</hi> which hath produced ſince the calling together of the great Councell of the Kingdom. But for that one <hi>Pollinex</hi> ſuffered by this authority, who was a man of excellent wit, knowledge, and courage, as well as his triall and condemnation remarkable. I ſhall particularly mention the paſſages.</p>
                  <p>As it was well known at what root the Senate of the Kingdome intended to ſtrike, being thus aſſembled, without the good liking of the King; ſo <hi>Pollinex</hi> could not chuſe but perceive the main marke they aimed at was his deſtruction, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chiefe man that would and durſt give his Maſter any counſell of contradiction: yet, having belike an abſolute confidence, either in his own innocency, or his Princes favour; withall, buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding perhaps too much upon his eloquence and parts, could not by any means be perſwaded to quit the Kingdome; wherefore, being preſently apprehended, a Tribunall was erected for his condemnation; however the Senate intended to be both Judges and accuſers, though my husband &amp; my ſelf were at the hearing, being deſirous out of ſome kind of curioſity, not onely to be ſatisfied concerning the crimes of <hi>Pollinex,</hi> but to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the proſecution. After the priſoner was brought to the bar, they wanted no force of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to render him ſeemingly guilty, to the admiring people; who had been made already ſufficiently prejudicate in their opinions, by thoſe which thought to gain by his deſtruction: And for the Nobility, that ſeemed by the Lawes

                  <p>But at laſt many of his Judges, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by the eloquence and powerfulneſſe of his arguments, or whether perſwaded to more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, by ſome hope to enter into the Kings favour, of a ſudden not onely forbore any more to inforce their allegations, but in direct termes, either profeſſed themſelves his friends, or ſeemed openly to pretend, as they had been formerly induced to thoughts of his condemnation, by the cries of the people, and opinions of his crimes, ſo were both their hearts and conſciences now altered towards his preſervation, in regard of thoſe reaſonable and juſt defences, he had made for himſelfe, publikely before the face of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. Nevertheleſſe both <hi>Dimogoras</hi> and the reſt of his faction, continued yet violent in their intended purpoſes, which was not onely by this means to pull <hi>Pollinex</hi> from the boſome of the King, but alſo to take away his life, leaſt he might againe mount into places of eminency, to their prejudice: yet doubting that by this way of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they ſhould not poſſibly compaſſe their ends, in that the Judges being onely of the Nobility,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98927:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>were divided in their opinions, reſolved upon paſſing a law in the Senate-houſe for his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>After they had totally declined the firſt manner of proſecution, it was not long before they put in execution the ſecond, whereupon poore <hi>Polli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex,</hi> was condemned to the ſlaughter; and not onely ſtood thus cenſured as a guilty perſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having liberty to ſpeake for himſelfe; but <hi>Euarchus</hi> was alſo conſtrained, by the cries and exclamations of the enraged people, to give his unwillingly conſent to this unfortunate and cruell judgement, though long he diſputed with his <hi>Flamins</hi> about it, who all perſwaded him to the compliance, rather then hazzard his own perſon, and the Kingdoms ruine.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the King had condeſcended to theſe particulars, with an intention to give the ſtrongeſt teſtimonies could any way be devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, towards the ſatisfying of the thoughts (if not rather the fancies) of his unbelieving ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; yet thoſe of <hi>Dimogoras</hi> faction in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, perceiving the Kings unwillingneſſe to this unexampled act of pretended juſtice, began to think, that if they could not alſo procure from his conſent, a perpetuall continuation of their own preſent power and authority, by ſome ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem or other, their own heads might ſoon pay for the violence uſed againſt <hi>Pollinex;</hi> wherefore it was conceived moſt neceſſary, whilſt they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to govern the actions of the people, by their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The ſecond, in regard the King might at his pleaſure, as was told him, deny the confirmation of any law ſhould be offred unto him, if hee thought it either prejudiciall to himſelfe or peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. With theſe ſuppoſitions, <hi>Euarchus</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to pleaſe his thoughts, and entertain his fancy; whilſt on the other ſide <hi>Dimogoras</hi> and his faction, did not onely extreamly rejoyce at the victory, their policy had gained over the Kings conſtancy, but began daily more and more to preſſe upon his patience, with other inconvenient, and I may ſay, moſt unreaſonable demands; in ſo much as he was forced to tempt the <hi>Myſſian</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, with a promiſe to make good unto that Nation, all their own deſires and pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, provided they would aſſiſt his preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, in the recovery of all thoſe priviledges he had lately parted from and loſt in the countrey of <hi>Lydia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This, I muſt tell you, ſeemed not onely to be agreed upon, but <hi>Euarchus</hi> himſelfe in perſon made a voyage preſently into <hi>Myſſia,</hi> whereby the

                  <p>In theſe perplexities both my ſelf and <hi>Euarchus</hi> remained for ſome moneths; finding that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate did not only overpower all our endeavours, notwithſtanding we deſired to give all ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction we could to the common people; but the <hi>Myſſians</hi> had deceived us in our expectations, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we had both thein promiſes and oathes to the contrary: ſo that after my mother was alſo baniſhed out of <hi>Lydia,</hi> taking counſell of our beſt thought, ſince we had few about us we could entirely truſt, we reſolved, as the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to try another part of the Kingdome for his future ſafety and content, ſo my ſelfe would make uſe of my intereſt with <hi>Orſames</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> notwithſtanding his great Favourite <hi>Philoſtros</hi> oppoſition, to ſee what aſſiſtance and reliefe, I could purchaſe for my hushand in his diſtreſſes againſt his own ſubjects; with theſe words the teares ſtood in her faire eyes, that ſeemed to ſtop

                  <p>However, replied the Queen, the conſequence of any rebellion or change of government in this
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98927:71"/>nature cannot be, but a moſt dangerous preſident to the kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> it ſelfe; eſpecially, it both the <hi>Myſſians</hi> and the Senate of <hi>Lydia</hi> doe joyn in ſuch an unity, that they can not be ſevered, by the intereſts or power of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for that, ſaid <hi>Candalus,</hi> the Favourite imagineth, that as there will be continuall facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diviſions amongſt themſelves, whereby upon all occaſions they may be divided, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any tie of friendſhip or agreement, ſo hath he laid, as he believeth, ſo perfect and ſtrong a foundation in his own countrey, that it is unpoſſible it ſhould rebell at any time to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, having not onely furniſhed all the fortified places, with plentifull garriſons of his own creatures, but by reaſon of the warre, he makes in every corner of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he hath the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of divers Armies, alwaies ready at his command, to ſuppreſſe any inſurrection whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: and the poorer the people are, according to his maximes, the leſſe capable of dangerous diſorders; for that their diſcontents ſhall rather produce diſtracted aſſemblies, then well deſigned or furniſhed Troops, having neither money to pay their ſouldiers, nor Captaines to lead their forces; ſo that of neceſſity if they riſe, they muſt become contemptible ſacrifices to his power and ſpleen, inſtead of eaſing of themſelves by their contentions.</p>
                  <p>Tis true brother, anſwered the Queen, I make no doubt but <hi>Philoſtros</hi> hath theſe thoughts in his imagination; yet, me thinks, he that pretends ſo much to the good and honour of <hi>Syria,</hi> ſhould

                  <p>Madam, replied <hi>Candalus,</hi> however I might alledge from the nature and proceedings of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtros,</hi> other pernicious maximes of State policy, uſed in the communication, and comportment of Princes in their governments, as for example; that it is better to hazzard, if not ſacrifice, a daughter of the royall houſe, then any way to loſe or endanger the leaſt good to the Kingdome; Yet I ſhall deſire you to believe, what I have ſpoke in this diſcourſe, are but the arguments of States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or rather you may interpret them my own fancies, the better to ſettle your thoughts againſt unexpected accidents, ſo that I ſhould think my wiſhes very fortunat if your perſwaſion can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile with your brothers goodneſſe, without the knowledge of his great Favourite, whereby it might procure you aſſiſtance, as my ſelfe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98927:74"/>cannot be but exaſperated againſt your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by reaſon of her fathers ſuffering, as ſhe may think, by your means; or elſe, take upon you ſome brave reſolution, to recover again your loſt countrey, which you have now a better op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity then ever to obtaine; for <hi>Orſames</hi> hath lately proclaimed open warres againſt the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> in the name of all the oppreſſed Princes, of which number I am ſure you cannot but be eſteemed one; and for the conveniency of both the deſignes, you may accompany us under your diſguiſed habit into <hi>Syria,</hi> without any ſuſpition at all; as well to attempt the love of the Princeſs <hi>Cloria</hi> in the journey, as to undertake the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of your Country when you are there, if you faile of the firſt. This propoſition of <hi>Eumenes,</hi> extreamly pleaſed <hi>Caſſianus;</hi> ſo that again his hopes ſeemed to invite his endeavours to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; onely there appeared yet this difficulty, how he could eaſily part from the old Forreſter, whom he had promiſed to accompany as long as he lived; and had to that purpoſe, by the ſale of his Jewels, provided himſelfe with all neceſſaries for ſuch a determination. But <hi>Eumenes</hi> told him, that as that obſtacle ought to be of too low a conſideration for his thoughts, ſince his birth and fortunes required the higheſt reſolutions, ſo of the other ſide, he could furniſh him with a moſt warrantable pretext, in that yeſternight, ſaid he, the Queen being in diſcourſe with her brother, about his returne into <hi>Syria,</hi> (which ſhe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, notwithſtanding her own preſſing occaſions, to ſollicite with all diligence) you may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98927:75"/>to be the meſſenger, to bring him back an anſwer of the ſucceſſe, and by that means have the opportunity, not onely to be admitted into the Queens traine, but in the journey be a daily attendant about your Miſtreſſes perſon. This was ſo farre from not contenting <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> that it almoſt raviſht his apprehenſions; whereupon, imbracing <hi>Eumenes,</hi> he told him, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his own ingratitude, he was ordained by the Gods to be the preſerver of his honour, if not the obtainer of his felicity.</p>
                  <p>Not many daies after this diſcourſe, when the Queen had refreſhed her ſelfe ſufficiently with her brothers contented ſolitude; and that prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was made of two good ſhips at the next Sea port, to carry her into <hi>Syria;</hi> the one for her one perſon, attended by her Ladies, and chiefe traine, the other for her horſes, with other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for the voyage; (in which latter how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Eumenes</hi> and <hi>Caſſianus</hi> choſe to goe, not onely becauſe they would give the women the greater liberty, but alſo have the more opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for their own private diſcourſes) they put to ſea one gentle morning, when the winde ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med moſt obedient to the intention, and ſailed all the day in ſuch a peaceable calme, as if <hi>Neptune</hi> meant to contribute his abſolute protection, in conducting the Queen to <hi>Tyre,</hi> a Haven where ſhe intended to diſimbarke for <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an houre before night, when the Sunne ſcarce appeared above the ſuperficies of the earth, the windes as it ſhould ſeem, inconſtant to their former reſolution, began firſt to quarrell with

                  <p>After the Duke had invited the Queen to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamine,</hi> which ſhe accepted within three daies,

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98927:78"/>brought them to a neerer neighbourhood: for whilſt <hi>Narciſſus</hi> father led the Queen up the ſtaires, he thought it his duty, as his ſonne, to offer the ſame ſervice to the daughter: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking her by the faire hand to perform the office, <hi>Cloria</hi> ſuddenly feeling the touch, which her modeſty had ſcarce ever been acquainted with from any other perſon, with a quick violence pluckt it from him, and hid it in her muffe. He too much apprehending the action, had hardly power with trembling ſteps, to carry himſelfe up into the room; yet, by that time having recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome breath, and conſidering his laſt part of Courtſhip was to be playd, ſince ſhe was ſhortly to be incloſed in her Chamber from his ſight, approached her eares with a few diſtracted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, which ſhe anſwered no otherwiſe then with a ſmile, and preſently ſeemed to flie to the protection of her mother, where ſhe remained as in a fortreſſe, free as ſhe conceived from his importunities, untill the Duke his father took his leave of the Queen, that neceſſarily commanded alſo <hi>Narciſſus</hi> from his tormenting delight, to wait upon his duty.</p>
                  <p>But the poore Boy, not being able to beare the ſtrong aſſaults of powerfull love, within a ſhort time began to looſe the beautie of his cheeks, and not long after fell into a moſt dangerous ſickneſſe; ſo that the Duke not knowing the ſecret cauſe of the violent diſtempers of his ſweet Sonne, with griefe and diligence aſſembled the beſt Phyſitians of thoſe parts; however, all their knowledges were not of ſufficient force, either to know the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98927:79"/>nature of his diſeaſe, or to cure his violent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie, which put the whole Court into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame perplexity, as himſelfe into a deſperate ſadneſſe; the rather for that melancholy ſighes, were the onely expreſſions which were uſed by love-ſick <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> untill one day the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> coming into the Chamber with the Queen her Mother, charitably to viſit her almoſt dead though unknowne Lover, and ſtanding by his bed-ſide, with teares alſo in her eyes, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly quickly found not onely an apparent change in his countenance, but the Doctors felt a violent alteration in his pulſe, which gave occaſion of ſome diſcourſe at the preſent, but of more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie afterward of the reaſon. Wherefore when the Queen with her fair Daughter were departed, and the reſt of the company ſevered from their attendants, the Duke by the adviſe of ſome of the Phyſitians, began to fall upon a ſtrict examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Sonne, and ſo farre preſt him to the diſcovery of his inward thoughts, that at laſt the youth not being able to ſhew much diſobedience to his Father, though his baſhfull love a long time contended againſt his duty, revealed not only the true cauſe of his paſſion, but the ſubject of his diſtempers: This gave the Dukes deſpaires ſome ſatisfaction, in that at leaſt he conceived he had got a knowledge, whereby his Sonne might dome to be recovered, though the remedie required to be applyed with as much expedition, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſeemed deſperate in operation. Wherefore after he had comforted the Boy, with as many hopes as poſſibly he could, the better to keepe up
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:98927:79"/>his courage, and ſo conſequently to procure eaſe in his paine, that he might have the more force to reſiſt the violence of his deſire, as well as the likelier to diſpoſe him for the cure, hee retired himſelfe into his owne Chamber, there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider with leſſe interruption, what courſe was to be taken for the purpoſe he intended; which was to ſave his Sonnes life, in whom conſiſted all his felicity, ſince he had only beſides one daughter, the faire <hi>Eretheria,</hi> who was not capable by reaſon of her Sex, to ſucceed to his honour, and command in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt he laid before his conſideration, the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impoſſibility of his Sons recoverie, without the aſſurance of <hi>Cloria</hi>'s affections, ſince the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians informed him, that the nature of love was of too violent a qualitie, to ſuffer any medicine to operate with effect in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Next he knew that was not to be obtained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Princeſs her ſelfe became the artiſt, which ſeemed to be a worke of no ſmall difficultie; Theſe difficulties continued the Dukes thoughts in a perplexed labyrinth, ſometimes conſidering his owne diſabilities to pretend to ſo high a match, ſince he was rather eſteemed a Subject and Servant to the State of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> then an abſolute Prince indeed in his power and command, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of the other ſide againe he reflected upon his owne worth, and upon the opinion the world had of his valour and riches; but that was ſcarce held competent in his imagination, when he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the attempt he was to make, was not onely
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98927:80"/>upon the primeſt beauty of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> but he was to contend with the honour and glory of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> who claimed an intereſt both in her bloud and quality.

                  <p>The Queene after ſhee had heard this ſtrange and unexpected diſcourſe of the Duke, did not of the ſudden well know what to anſwer; of the one ſide conſidering the high conſequence of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; as of the other, the great need ſhee might have of his helpe, beſides the preſent entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhee received in his Country, with the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate condition of his onely Son, fallen into the accidentall misfortune by her owne perſonall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus:</hi> but having a pretty while pawſed upon a reply, not to be too raſh in uttering that, which paſt ſhee could not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, at laſt ſhee returned him this anſwer, with a countenance that expreſſed feare, doubt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: My Lord, ſaid ſhee, as the noble courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which you have been pleaſed to caſt upon me in my neceſſities, with that humane conſideration

But <hi>Cloria</hi> ſoon diſcovering by her Governeſſes fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned gravity, that ſhe made requeſt onely to jeere her, preſently with the apprehenſion began to bluſh: At which <hi>Roxana</hi> laughed in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; and that drove ſweet <hi>Cloria</hi> abſolutely out of countenance, in ſo much as with a kind of a gentle anger, mixt with an innocent ſhame, ſhe wept; which certainly had drawn on a more dangerous quarrell, between her and her Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if a meſſenger from the Queen, had not commanded <hi>Cloria</hi> to wait upon her mother, to certain pleaſures of hawking, prepared for her delight and recreation, that diverted for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the contention.</p>
                  <p>However love ſeemed now to triumph of his conqueſt, over theſe two excellent creatures; yet the ſpightfull deſtinies would not with ſo much happineſſe, ſuffer them to enjoy the ſweetneſſe of their delightfull converſation; for the Queen falling ſick by reaſon of her late diſtempers at ſea, and the Duke being call'd away to his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like imployment againſt the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> theſe accidents ſeparated their perſons, though not their affections, to both their diſcontentments; for neceſſarily <hi>Narciſſus</hi> muſt accompany his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the journey: which kept the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> ſome time after, as it were wedded to her own lodgings, unleſſe it were, as her duty invited her, to viſit her mother; pretending however,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98927:82"/>her retiredneſſe proceeded from the Queens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>But the Princeſs at laſt being atogether tired with keeping the houſe, one evening ſhe call'd her Governeſſe to accompany her into the fields to take ſome taſte of the freſh aire; where long ſhe had not ſpent that time, that ſhe rendred alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether innocent by her hurtleſſe imployment, now and then plucking the beauties of nature, that appeared to put on a more cheerfull look, to be handled by ſuch delicacy; (for though their wild growth, afforded them not ſo much ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe as domeſtick flowers, yet her pure breath ſeemed to ſupply that defect, as ſhe carried them in her faire hand) before ſhe encountred with a lovely countrey maid, bearing upon her arme a white basket, covered with a whiter cloth; the The young damſell at the ſight of the Princeſſe, not onely ſtood ſtill in a trembling poſture, as if her own baſhfulneſſe had a little diſtracted her, but withall cauſed her to dreſſe her countenance with ſuch interchanges of red and white, that <hi>Cloria</hi> with a pretty ſmile at the Girles confuſion, began to interrogate her of her name, friends, and buſineſſe; unto which the girle, after ſhe had borrowed leave of her feares, by the Princeſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, told her ſhe was called <hi>Aminta,</hi> born of countrey parents, not farre off; and ſaid, her buſineſſe was to ſeek ſome good ſervice, for that her father being lately preſt a ſouldier for the warres of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> had left her to the world, to procure her own ſubſiſtance; with that wept, as if her neceſſities were yet more preſſing then ſhe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:98927:83"/>was willing to expreſſe by words. <hi>Cloria,</hi> being wholy overcome by a Noble paſſion, reflecting upon the youth and beauty of the maid, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the fearfull baſhfulneſſe of her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, turned her ſelfe preſently to <hi>Roxiana,</hi> and deſired her that ſhe would be ſo charitable, as to entertain the girle as a new ſervant, becauſe without her mothers approbation, as ſhe ſaid, ſhe could not admit her to be one of her own at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; which however <hi>Roxiana</hi> for ſome time reſiſted, as being unwilling in a ſtrange Countrey to burden her ſelfe with the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of her traine; yet by the powerfull impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the Princeſſe, at laſt ſhe diſpenced ſo farre with her rigid providence, as to admit of <hi>Aminta</hi> for one of her followers. This gave oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the maid preſently to fall down upon her knees, whereby humbly to acknowledge the favour at no leſſe a rate, then the preſerving of her reputation, if not the ſaving of her life; ſince, as ſhe confeſſed, ſhe knew not what friends to flie to for ſuccour or counſell: withall, uncovering the basket that reſted upon her arme, wherein was diſcovered variety of choice fruits, ſhe preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as a token of her ſervice and gratitude to the faire Princeſſe, beſeeching her ſhe would be pleaſed to accept of ſuch dainties, as the place of her fathers habitation did afford; that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as ſhe ſaid, might be enriched by her taſte, to prove of a greater value then they ſeemed: then retiring again with ſo becomming a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, that the court breeding in the comely maid, appeared onely to have put on a countrey attire,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98927:83"/>which made them wonder at her behaviour with an extraordinary delight.</p>
                  <p>But the lateneſſe of the evening gave <hi>Roxana</hi> warning to ſolicite <hi>Cloria</hi> to retire, leaſt the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the dew might either injure her health, or prejudice her complexion, which for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent afforded onely conveniency of diſcourſe in the way, though the Princeſſe afterward was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well, but when ſhe had the maid in her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: And this in time ſo increaſed her affection, that ſhe made her in a manner her onely play-fellow; ſcarce delighting in any converſation but in young <hi>Amintas,</hi> whoſe countenance and actions put on ſuch a grave ſadneſſe and reſpective diligence; that as of one ſide ſhe ſeemed only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to pleaſe her miſtreſſe, ſo of the other ſhe appeared too ſerious for the worlds converſation; but the Princeſs, finding by <hi>Amintas</hi> frequent ſighs, that ſomething more then a naturall ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or a dutifull reſpect poſſeſſed her thoughts, ſhe not onely oftentimes enquired of the cauſe of her griefe, but narrowly look'd into the demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of her Governeſſe, whoſe ſeverity ſhe might feare, had procured ſome diſcontent in her gentle boſome. Yet, being not able to extort from the maid her ſelfe any confeſſion, and alſo <hi>Roxana</hi> aſſuring her, that no hard uſage of hers, cauſed her melancholy, <hi>Cloria</hi> one day reſolved to try her uttermoſt skill, whereby to be informed of the the ſecret myſterie of <hi>Amintas</hi> ſad expreſſions; and the rather for that her complexion ſeemed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſuffer in the concealment, or at leaſtwiſe ſo interpreted by her thoughts.</p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:98927:84"/>
                  <p>Wherefore one day ſhe commanding her to attend her perſon, into a certain walke neere the houſe, where ſhe was accuſtomed often to take her recreation, it being a place defended from the heat of the Sunne, and the violence of the windes, by the naturall ſcituation of a pleaſant grove of trees; the Princeſs being there arrived ſeated her ſelfe upon a little riſing bank, which art appeared to have raiſed for ſuch a purpoſe, whilſt in the mean time <hi>Aminta</hi> ſtood by her in reſpective attendance. But <hi>Cloria</hi> rather aiming at the execution of her intention, then the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of her ſervant, according to her uſuall cuſtome when no body was preſent, commanded her to thoſe familiarities ſhe was moſt delighted withall, which was to ſit down by her, ſince youth is better pleaſed with freedome in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, then ſtate reſervedneſſe in actions. When ſhe had thus placed her ſelfe, the Princeſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many circumſtances in words, (for that her paſſion to be reſolved, as it ſhould ſeem, was too violent to be delayed) conjured her by her own duty, and that love ſhe bore her, which if ſhe proved over obſtinate, as ſhe ſaid, might be loſt, to diſcover unto her the cauſe of her ſadneſſe or griefe, which her frequent ſighes ſufficiently expreſt to be engrafted in her ſoule, proceeding from ſome hidden reaſon not yet revealed. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta</hi> by the Princes importunity, whoſe love and ſeverity ſeemed prettily woven together, after a few teares mixt with many pauſes, and two or three deep ſighs, as if her tongue were afraid to become a traytor to her heart in the diſcovery, uttered theſe words.</p>

                  <p>Moſt faire Princeſs, ſaid ſhe, let the Gods be onely blamed, if I am compelled to ſay, it is no other then your ſelfe that cauſeth my ſmart. <hi>Cloria</hi> finding an anſwer ſo much againſt her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and much more intention, could not chuſe but look her full in the face, though with a kind of ſilent reproofe, as if ſhe rather yet excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her own ignorance, then accuſed <hi>Aminta's</hi> ſuſpition; but the maid redoubling her words, like a fierce tyrant with multitude of blows, when he had his enemy at his mercy: Nay, ſaid ſhe; you have cruelly, as I feare, conſpired my life; and which is worſe, no phyſick can be applied to my wounded ſoule, but what remedies your ſelfe ſhall bring; like the Scorpion, that onely heales what hurt his ſting procured: <hi>Cloria</hi> being ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at theſe expreſſions; <hi>Aminta,</hi> after ſome pauſe again, uttered this language, know dear <hi>Cloria,</hi> that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> cannot live without the converſation of his admired and beloved Miſtreſſe, which onely hath cauſed this ſtrange metamorphoſis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your eyes, to be turned to a more deadly forme, if you cruelly deny the grace that I humbly require. By this Rhetorick the Princeſſe was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently informed of her patient: however, for ſome time ſhe reſted ſilent, untill at laſt ſhe deſired to know how he could excuſe his abſence to his father? <hi>Narciſſus</hi> quickly anſwered, that preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a journey into <hi>Syria,</hi> to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the faſhions and cuſtomes of that Court, he had procured leave to travell for ſome while, though he intended to make no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a voyage then to her beautious ſelfe, in
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98927:85"/>which ſchoole all excellency and content, as he ſaid, was to be perfectly learned; then held his peace with ſuch a begging look, that <hi>Cloria</hi> had ſcarce power to contradict: untill with teares in her faire eyes, ſhe after ſome ſmall ſilence uſed theſe words:</p>
                  <p>Deare <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> ſaid ſhe, for ſo I muſt call you, in that you have endeavoured to merit that name at my hands; though I cannot but reprove the over holdneſſe of your atempt, ſince thereby it ſhould ſeem, you have miſ-interpreted all my favours; having ſo little reſpect to my honour, as that you have borrowed this falſe diſguiſe, to ſatisfie your pretended paſſion, which the world will neither excuſe in you, nor allow in me, if it be once known, how you were ſecretly entertained by my allowance, in the habit of a Countrey-maid: yet to let you ſee how charitable I am, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your tranſgreſſion, I freely forgive the fault paſt, ſo you will now repent, and make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, in your returning ſpeedily againe from whence you came, not giving me further occaſion to be jealous of my never yet ſuſpected modeſty; this being ſaid, ſhe ended with ſuch a looke, as ſhewed plainly ſhe ſpake againſt the deſires of her own heart. But <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who could put no leſſe a difference between his admittance and deniall, then a moſt unkind and cruell baniſhment, told her, that if ſhe had a will to deſtroy him, ſhe might enjoyn that penance, ſince he was reſolved to abſtaine from all naturall food, unleſſe hee ſhould be fed in her preſence, by the ſight of her perfections; and with that caſt down his eyes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98927:85"/>with ſo ſorrowfull a look upon the ground, as if he ſought nothing but a grave, ſince he could not enjoy the life of her converſation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cloria,</hi> after ſhe had attentively beheld him, and then look'd up at the heavens, as if from thence ſhe expected ſupernaturall aſſiſtance, and again reſted ſilent, with abundance of teares guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violently from her fair eyes, at laſt broke out into theſe imprecations: that if ever by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, his being with her in a diſguiſed habit, came to be revealed to the knowledge of the world, ſhe vowed by ſome means or other to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come her own executioner, as a bloody teſtimony of her abſolute chaſt intentions; in the mean time, ſhe told him, to ſatisfie his pleaſures, he was too cruel to exact from her ſuch deſperate conditions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> ſcarce hearing what ſhe ſaid, being tranſported with ſuch a joy, as religious men uſe to poſſeſſe in extaſies, not onely having broken through the diſcoverie, but in being ſo beyond his hopes accepted, began to grow bold in his felicity, in ſo much as he could not forbeare, to imprint loves character upon her fair lips, untill ſhe in a grave diſdaine, to be ſo aſſaulted by his preſumption, not onely commanded him in a ſevere look to keepe at a farther diſtance, but withall told him, that he had already ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly provoked her juſt anger, that it was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deſtroy thoſe ſmall ſparkles of love, which charity had kindled in her compaſſionate bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; And with that haſtily roſe from her ſeat, with ſuch another bluſh, as inflamed <hi>Diana's</hi> baſhfull modeſty, to become cruelly revengefull;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98927:86"/>which preſently turned the youth, into an immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable poſture, ſcarce knowing whether he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed or no. The ſudden comming of <hi>Roxana</hi> to ſeek the Princeſs gave no time at all for expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that abſolutely left <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to converſe onely with his own deſpaire, ſince ſhe and her Governeſſe went preſently to viſite the ſicke Queen.</p>
                  <p>However the Princeſs <hi>Cloria,</hi> though ſhe uſed not thoſe familiarities with her play-fellow <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minta,</hi> (being over jealous of her own honour) as ſhe was accuſtomed, yet ſhe forbore not ſtill to command her ſervice upon all occaſions, and with gentle ſmiles would often ſhew, ſhe was not unrecoverably diſpleaſed with her, for her late paſſionate attempt, though ſhee totally avoided her company in private; which was the reaſon that frequently ſhe and <hi>Roxana,</hi> would walk to a certain cliffe by the Sea ſide, where was a grove of Cypres trees, that afforded a convenient ſhade, to protect their converſation from the Sunne or Windes violence; whilſt in the mean time they might with what liberty they pleaſed, behold the ſhips that entered the Haven not farre off that place. And this delight, one day above the reſt, not onely invited the Princeſs <hi>Cloria,</hi> in the coole of the day to the accuſtomed recreation; but cauſed her to deſire her Governeſs that ſhe would heare her play of her Lute, to try whether by the occaſion of her journey, ſhe had not for want of practice, loſt that little skill ſhe formerly had; which being accompanied by her excellent voice, that uttered this Ditty, in a manner raviſhed the

And this being ſaid, ſhee poured forth a ſhower of teares, as a charitable teſtimony that her heart accompanied her words in the requeſt.</p>
                  <p>The barbarous Judge of <hi>Roxana's</hi> life, ſeeing himſelfe entreated by ſo ſweet an Advocate, and with a humility anſwerable to his owne rude pride, which rather mollified his Tygers boſome, then perſwaded his reaſon to become humane, after ſome pawſe, in imperious words bid her riſe; then having conſulted with the reſt of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he told her that her ſuite was granted, ſo farre as to have a reprieve for her Governeſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they were both preſented unto the Admirall of their Fleet, who lay not at any great diſtance from that place, expecting their ſpeedy returne, which would determine as he ſaid his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſince he was onely put in command to execute the ſervice he had already performed; And with that gave direction to have the boat haſted to the ſhippes, which was accompliſhed within an houres ſpace, though before their arrivall the Sun
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98927:89"/>had already hid his face below the horizon, as if aſhamed to behold ſo great a misfortune. The Princeſs <hi>Cloria</hi> was quickly brought into the Captaines Cabin, where himſelfe ſitting upon his bed, ſcarce roſe to give her a civill ſalutation; however, ſhe being more mindfull of <hi>Roxana's</hi> danger, then of her own unhappineſſe, preſently beg'd the life and releaſement of her Governeſſe; which gave an occaſion to the proud Admirall, not onely ſomething to compaſſionate her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe, but to be more inflamed with her beauty; and theſe thoughts continued him ſome time in a ſilent muſe, untill of a ſudden he brake out into this language: Is it poſſible the earth can produce ſuch becomming perfections in ſorrow? and with that preſently commanded not only the old woman to be abſolutely releaſed from her bonds, but to be forthwith returned to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her miſtreſſe, where he left them both in his own lodging, whilſt himſelfe went to give ſome neceſſary order in the ſhips.</p>

                     <hi>Cloria,</hi> although ſhe was ſomething ſatisfied, to have again the converſation of her Governeſſe, whom ſhe eſteemed almoſt loſt, yet (conſidering the miſerable eſtate ſhe was in, to be under the power of ſuch a barbarous captivity; ſeparated in this violent way from the protection of her deare mother, who could not as ſhe conceived, but almoſt die with ſorrow and griefe, when ſhe ſhould either be advertiſed of the particulars of her miſ-fortune, or not know what was become of her;) began this complaint: Alas <hi>Cloria,</hi> ſaid ſhe, what have been thy offences to the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98927:89"/>Gods, to plunge thee in theſe exquiſite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, not poſſible in a manner to be ſuffered by humane nature? was it not ſufficient to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from thy father and Countrey, wherein thou enjoyedſt both ſafety and honour, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as it were, in the company of thy mother, to a voluntary baniſhment, rather then endure the affronts of thy fathers perſecutors? but of a ſudden, to be deprived of that joy was onely left thee, and be caſt into a power more cruell then Tigers, and more inhumane then wild people? And with this wrung her delicate hands, with ſuch expreſſions of paſſion, that <hi>Roxana</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for ſome time to leave her thoughts, whereby to apply remedies to her Miſtris griefe.</p>
                  <p>Madam, ſaid ſhe, if the Gods could at any time be juſtly taxed for their permiſſion of injuries upon innocents, certainly at this preſent they merit reproof beyond example, ſince the wrong is done to ſo high a goodnes as the world again can ſcarce parallel; but ſeeing their inſcrutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are not to be ſearched into by weak morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, without ſuch a reverence as muſt onely pray for redreſſe, it is farre more available to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition, to conſider with patience what is beſt to be done, then to ſeem rebellious to their wils, in not well ſuffering what cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prevented, which at leaſtwiſe may bring with it forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, if not conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of our puniſhments; ſince for the moſt part afflictions in this world, are onely ſent us to correct our ſtubborn natures, making us more fit for the Gods mercier; and not abſolutely to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98927:90"/>deſtroy us, by rendring us ſubjects for their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere juſtice; for truely, as I cannot believe; but that they have reſerved for your goodneſſe a particular protection; ſo of the other ſide, I am confident, that when the chaſtiſement, or rather I may ſay the triall of your ſingular vertues, is paſt, the inſtruments of your preſent puniſhment, will be caſt into the fire, and you not at all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by the ſuffering, unleſſe you prove more obſtinate, or impatient, then you ſhould be. Beſides, you ought to conſider, you are <hi>Euarchus</hi> daughter, a Prince of ſuch excellent parentage and blood, that the leaſt dejection of ſpirit, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the greateſt miſ-fortune, would degenerate you from your birth and education; and yet no way leſſen the miſery of your capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; though I would not have your quality come to the knowledge of theſe inhumane Pirates; for augmenting the price of your redemption, ſince covetouſneſſe is the onely deity they ſerve, and the ſole period of their paines; wherefore, I beſeech you to put off ſo much of your confuſed griefe, that may preſerve your health, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you more capable of counſell, whereby we may the better ſtudy your ſafety, and both our freedomes: and with that took her in her armes, where ſhe held her, untill her loving endeavours had rockt her into a quiet ſlumber, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for moſt part of the night: by this <hi>Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> had liberty in the mean time, the better to converſe with her own wit and judgement, how to finde means for their ſpeedy delivery: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhe thought, of preſenting thoſe Jewels they

                  <p>Lady, ſaid ſhe, although you may put on won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at my ſeeming prepoſterous approach, yet I ſhould be ſorry to procure your diſturbance by my preſence, ſince my intention is to doe you acceptable ſervice, though I am now deſigned to a worſe end; but firſt you muſt underſtand my unhandſome ſtory, for your more confidence:
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98927:91"/>Then know, I am a <hi>Syrian</hi> born; and being, ſome yeeres paſt in my fathers houſe, a rich Merchant of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> I fell in love with a Gentleman of the ſame Town, of no great poſſeſſions; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my paſſion continued ſo violent, that I was reſolved, againſt the good will of all my friends, to make him my husband; in proſecution of which, without much circumſtance, we watched an opportunity to crown our affections, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying one another, before the ceremonious rights belonging to ſacred marriage, were performed in <hi>Plymens</hi> Temple; which perhaps too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the Gods, and cauſed my misfortunes: For being careleſſe to delude the watchfull and ſpightfull ſpies, of the houſe of my father, one night when we leaſt look'd for his preſence, he was brought to be an eye-witneſſe of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracements; at which ſight, my lover being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a deſperate rage to be ſo ſurprized, ſuddenly leapt out of his naked bed, to prevent his own apprehenſion, ſince the fact was no leſſe then death in him, by the rigid and unkind laws of <hi>Syria;</hi> but being ſtopt at the doore, by my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fury, hee quickly flew to the protection of his ſword, that was not farre off his unhappy reach; and ſeeing by no intreaty he could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade paſſage, he made forcible way through my fathers life, ſo eſcaped all their endeavours, by his preſent flight; which, as you may believe, was a ſufficient torment to my perplexed minde, for that every ballad of the Town ſung my ſhame, and my Lovers cruelty; and this quickly cauſed me to ſeek another habitation, though the wealth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98927:91"/>that was left me, as being heire, might in ſome ſort have bought my quiet. With theſe thoughts I put to ſea, carrying along with me ſuch move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, as I could handſomely diſpoſe of to that purpoſe, with an intention if it were poſſible, in this poſture to finde out the abode of my baniſhed Lover; or elſe, in ſome unknown place to ſet up the ſtation of mine own reſt. But my unhappy Fates, rather reflecting upon my former crime, then my preſent miſery, never left perſecuting me with contrary windes and ſtormes, untill they put me into the abſolute poſſeſſion of theſe mercileſſe Pirates, where ever ſince I have lived, the abuſed ſtrumpet of the Captaines luſt, though flattered alwaies, not onely with the hope, but promiſe of a ſpeedy marriage; theſe prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations, continued me untill now, reaſonably wel ſatisfied: but ſince your ſurprizall, you muſt know, he hath caſt his burning affection upon the more rare beauty of the Princeſs <hi>Cloria,</hi> though he dares not openly own the love, becauſe there is ſo ſtrong a faction in the ſhip againſt the deſigne; for that they put on a reſolution to preſent the Lady to <hi>Oſirus,</hi> the Kings ſonne of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whereby the better to procure their own pardons, for thoſe robberies they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted upon his ſhore, having been in time paſt his naturall ſubjects: to this purpoſe, the better to compaſſe, though to colour his deſire, he hath imployed me as an inſtrument to your ſelfe, ſuppoſing you have an abſolute intereſt with the Princeſſe, to perſwade her, by a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe hee will provide, to convey her ſelfe to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98927:92"/>morrow night, out of this ſhip into another of more fidelity, which ſhall carry her to a Caſtle belonging to his command; from whence hee vows, though untruly, ſhe ſhall be returned ſafe to her friends and countrey; pretending he neither dares truſt her, or himſelfe, in the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> power. But I, finding he hath an intention to deale falſe with me, after my diſhonour, I have alſo deceived him, and made ſome of the contrary faction, acquainted with his paſſions; who will be ſure to prevent his purpoſes, ſince they doe not onely hate him, for his injuſtice towards themſelves, in diſtributing unequally thoſe boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which have been from time to time gotten by <hi>Pyracy;</hi> but now in ſeeking to hinder, by his private love, ſo fortunate an occaſion to procure all their pardons. Scarce had ſhe delivered thus much, but the Captaine, like ſome furious wilde beaſt (having overheard her diſcourſe, by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate whiſpering place, he had out of his own lodging, into the other Cabine where <hi>Cloria</hi> reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) came into the room with his ſword drawn, firſt killing the woman with his looks, and after forced the weapon to perform the reſt; which not onely ſuddenly awakened the ſweet Princeſs, but with horrour of the ſpectacle, ſoon forced <hi>Roxana</hi> out of the Cabine with fearfull ſhreekes, that preſently with a confuſed diſtraction call'd up all the company in the ſhip.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, whilſt all of them, were laying hold of ſuch weapons as came next to their hands, to defend themſelves againſt they knew not what danger, the Captaine addreſt him to the amazed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98927:92"/>Princeſſe, in this language: Lady, ſaid he, you ſee here plainly the force of love, that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move any obſtacle that doth oppoſe it; ſince the puniſhment of this treacherous woman, by my juſt hand, is a ſufficient teſtimony of my violent affection. But poore <hi>Cloria</hi> was ſo farre from underſtanding what he meant, (apprehending alſo the horrid ſpectacle of the dead body, which lay before her eyes) that inſtead of making him any reply tending to his ſatisfaction, ſhe ſhewed him her naked breaſt, wiſhing him to diſpatch her preſently, that ſhe might not undergoe many torments by his cruelty. The captaine of the other ſide, being tranſported with that taking object, inſtantly flung away his ſword, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down by her bed, as if he intended to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſome Deity, gently fixt a kiſſe, with his impure lips, upon that more then white Altar; continuing in that poſture, untill <hi>Roxana's</hi> cries had brought to the doore many of the <hi>Pyrates;</hi> who, with a tumultuous noiſe, not onely entred, but finding the dead carcaſe of the ſlaughtered woman, and alſo the ſuſpected demeanour of the <hi>Admirall,</hi> by reaſon of that information they had formerly received of the dead Strumpet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his private love to the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> ſuddenly threatned him with this language: Villaine, ſaid they, was it not enough injuſtice in thee, to have oftentimes, by thy imperious commands, defrauded us of the equall diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch prizes we had gotten at Sea? but to endeavour alſo to deceive us of our hopes of our pardons, by the raviſhment of the faire Princeſſe,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98927:93"/>which is a preſent we intend to <hi>Oſirus,</hi> to redeem our lives and liberties, and render us again poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of our native Countrey, from whence we have been ſo long baniſhed, under thy proud ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</p>
                  <p>The Captaine, being not able to ſupport this ſharp reproofe from his baſe vaſſals, of a ſudden leapt to his ſword that lay upon the ground, and when he had it in his hand, flew amongſt them like a Tiger, calling to his ayde ſuch in the ſhip as were faithfull to his faction, which ere long procured a moſt bloody encounter; for what the <hi>Admirals</hi> party wanted in number, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in courage, ſo that the fight a great while ſeemed to be equall; wherein the uncouthneſſe of the ſeaſon, added horrour to the ſlaughters; aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented alſo by the cries of dying &amp; wounded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, with the whiſtling of the winds, that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to contend with the ſeas in a new combat; but at laſt, the Captain himſelfe being ſlaine, a ſudden deſpaire ſeized the remaining company, in ſo much as they all either fled to ſeek refuge into dark corners of the ſhip, or yeelded to the mercy of the conquerours; who putting the head of their late Lord upon a Speare, crying Liberty, ſhewed it to the people of the other veſſels, not farre off; and preſently ſent a meſſenger, not onely to inform them of their proceedings, and juſt judgement againſt their tyrannicall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, but to deſire a conference, how they might beſt diſpoſe of their affaires to procure all their pardons.</p>
                  <p>During the conflict, the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> as it
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98927:93"/>were tranſported beyond all degrees of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather conceived her ſelfe to be in a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dream, then the beholder of ſuch inhumane actions, lay as it were without motion, untill <hi>Roxana,</hi> who had newly broke through the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed crowd, came into the Cabine to give her deare Lady ſome conſolation. After ſhe had a little driven away her feares, and comforted her hopes with couragious language, ſhe not onely recounted unto her all the particulars of the fight, and the occaſion thereof, but informed her of the reſolution of the <hi>Pyrates,</hi> which was, inſtantly to convey her into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and put her into the protection of <hi>Oſirus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cloria,</hi> when ſhe had ſpent ſome time in teares, ſighes, and ſilence, at laſt uttered theſe words: O <hi>Roxana,</hi> ſaid ſhe, we may perceive that the gods are angry with us, and therefore the ſucceſſe of our fortunes cannot be but doubtfull; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we may be delivered from this barbarous captivity, and committed into more Noble hands; for I feare that <hi>Oſirus</hi> will never forget, the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that have been done unto him, for the loſſe of his great fleet upon the <hi>Ionian</hi> ſhore, though my father himſelfe was betrayed to the action; nor forbeare with violence to ſolicite his old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed love, by my Grandmother Queen <hi>Anaxia;</hi> which either muſt abſolutely deſtroy my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to poore <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> or put me in ſome deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate prevention; ſince his thoughts cannot be ſo low, as to ſuffer himſelfe to be undervalued, by a captive that he hath in his power; upon which ground, I ſuppoſe the Pirates have taken
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98927:94"/>their reſolutions. Theſe were reaſons ſufficient to have converted <hi>Roxana,</hi> although ſhe had been of another opinion; however, being more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to apply balme, then corraſives, to the wound that was already made, onely returned her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of hope, and not replies of deſpaire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine her imagination, untill the thieves reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, within two daies and a nights ſaile, the winds ſeeming in the mean time to play with their intentions, had brought them ſafely into the river of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and ſo conſequently ſoon lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, with their rich prize, at the City of <hi>Memphis,</hi> where <hi>Oſirus</hi> the Prince, then kept his Court.</p>
                  <p>But the Heavens being not pleaſed that ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable a Jewell, ſhould be the price to buy the redemption of ſo vile offenders, the <hi>Pyrates,</hi> were preſently apprehended, and not onely in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their many robberies, but alſo of their late murder committed, without form of Law upon their Captain, were put to death with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall torments, as an example of terrour to their imitators; whilſt in the mean time the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> was with all honour conveyed to lodgings prepared for her in the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Yet one day, being alone with <hi>Roxana,</hi> and reflecting not onely upon the horrid danger ſhe had paſt, when ſhe was in the abſolute power of the rude <hi>Pyrates;</hi> but conſidering what a heaven of felicity, her outward ſenſe ſeemed to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted withall, now ſhe was in the glorious Pallace of <hi>Oſirus,</hi> King almoſt of all <hi>Aphrica,</hi> where every one appeared ready to comply with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:98927:94"/>her pleaſure, as ſhe underſtood by the command of their great maſter, ſhe could not but with ſome penſiveneſſe, think upon the ſudden change of her fortune; for weighing the tickliſhneſſe of her own ſtate, that had in ſo ſhort a time, woven her thoughts and loves, into ſo many hopes and fears, it began to raiſe in her ſome doubt of her yet ſafety; and conſidering that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> had received too many affronts, to be heartily affected to the <hi>Lydians,</hi> ſhe could interpret <hi>Oſirus</hi> kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe but two waies: either that he bore a Noble minde, beyond example, notwithſtanding her Countries ſeeming injuries; or elſe, that he had ſome underhand deſigne to compaſſe, which made him gild over his intentions with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward humanity, whereby the better to obtaine his ends, or render his revenge more terrible; which at laſt made her break through her ſilence, by this diſcourſe to her Governeſſe.</p>
                  <p>What the gods have determined of us <hi>Roxana,</hi> ſaid ſhe, their onely divine wiſdomes muſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out in time, and we with patience and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence are to attend the iſſue of their decrees; for if in any kind they ſeem to ſmile upon our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, we ſhould entertaine the bleſſings with a joyfull humility, rather uſing them as neceſſary refreſhments of humane nature, then eſteeming them determinable ſubſtances of our abſolute happineſſe, ſince pleaſures here are neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their delights, nor certain in their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance: ſo of the other ſide, if rough misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes at any time, overwhelme that calm which we covet, we ought piouſly to take them as deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:98927:95"/>chaſtiſements, to keep under the proud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions of our perverſe nature (that elſe might ſwell to our perpetuall deſtruction) ſent rather to cure our deſeaſes, then to encreaſe our maladies; and in this conſideration, no doubt, we may ſafely walk, in all the various accidents of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour world: however, though reaſon dictates to our underſtanding, this juſt and religious courſe, yet we cannot be without all naturall and humane paſſion. Wherefore, as in the firſt place, with ſome joy we may conſider <hi>Roxana,</hi> this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected change of entertainment; from a horrid captivity amongſt thieves, to a moſt civill ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in <hi>Oſirus</hi> Court; for though the one had no cauſe, but gaine, to make them our enemies; yet the other hath reaſon, by received injuries, not to be our friends: ſo of the other ſide, I muſt confeſſe, an undigeſted lump of ſuſpition, ſeems to oppreſſe my fearfull thoughts, what may be the intention of our fates: though, I vow by the immortall Gods, rather to ſhew an exemplary hate upon my own life, then conſent to give away that faith I have determined to abſent <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> and with thoſe words, a ſweet ſhowre of teares burſt from the heaven of her eyes, capable to teach the earth a new beauty in ſorrow, ſilently enriching her handkerchiefe with the pearles that fell; which gave occaſion to <hi>Roxana</hi> (after ſhe had ſome time with a little ſeeming admiration weighed the diſcreet Rhetorick of the Princeſſe) to return her this anſwer.</p>

For as the works of the divine Creator are wonderfull in their effects, ſo they ought to be gratefull in their reception, ſince they proceed from an omnipotent good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and if at any time they appeare to us, either vain, or unjuſt, it is the ignorant indulgence of our own frailty, that makes us either falſly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret them, or paſſionately wiſh them otherwiſe: for as humane nature loves it ſelfe beſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſequently covets its own ſatisfaction, above all other things; ſo of the other ſide, the great God that made us onely for his glory, will not admit, of ſuch a rebellion in our thoughts and actions to be unpuniſhed, much leſſe to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; and therefore he puts oftentimes a ſtop to our idle deſires, by a ſharp reſtriction of our wils, when they ſwell beyond the bounds of duty and thankfulneſſe towards him, that of nothing formed us, and can make us worſe when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth; for the chiefe errour of our impatience is, that we take our ſelves more framed for our own ſakes, then for his ſervice; whereas, if we would imploy all our endeavours, towards the true end of our creation, we ſhould neither miſſe of an abſolute reward hereafter, nor undergoe here the irkſomneſſe of perturbations; ſince the intention
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:98927:96"/>would enflame the mind to higher deſires, then meerly fleſh and bloud can reach unto, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend but preſent and ſenſuall things. Nay further, if we doe but truely conſider, how little ſatisfactory the beſt of pleaſures is, as you even now ſaid (having neither any certainty in the enjoyment, nor perfect delight in the fruition) man would eſteem himſelfe no other then mad, ſo violently to hunt after worldly things; which Madam, I hope are arguments ſufficient, both to confirm the former part of your diſcourſe, and to diſſwade you to put in execution the latter, if accidents ſhould make warre againſt your vertue. But as her words were brought to this period, they were both informed that <hi>Oſirus</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to viſit the Princeſſe, ſo that <hi>Cloria</hi> had no opportunity left her for reply, ſcarce for prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to receive ſuch a ſtranger.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Oſirus</hi> entred the room, he made his approach in a formall garbe, according to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> manner; his looks putting on Majeſty, though his cloaths humility, and notwithſtanding he uſed complements in his words, yet <hi>Cloria</hi> might finde by his language, he knew he was Lord of her liberty; withall intimating, that ſhe received honor in being in the cuſtody of ſo great a Prince; however, it was his deſire, as he ſaid, to make her in a kind, not onely her own Gaoler, but his Miſtreſſe; and with that turned his eyes upon his followers, as if he expected an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, by their applauſe; which gave <hi>Cloria</hi> ſome liberty to ſtudy for an anſwer, conceiving her thoughts abſolutely neceſſary, ſince the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98927:96"/>of his diſcourſe, ſo little pleaſed her fearfull apprehenſion; wherefore after ſome time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in a trembling ſilence, with a humility anſwerable to that power he had over her perſon, ſhe made him this reply.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, ſaid ſhe, although I cannot but thank my fortune, for having delivered me into ſo noble hands, where honour and vertue ſeem to be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the making up an abſolute greatneſſe in your perſon; yet I muſt needs believe, liberty would have afforded me much more cauſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, ſince it is a humane miſery to be impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, though it be in a golden Tower; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing endued with life and motion, but certainly covets a freedome in its own diſpoſe, rather then to be captied of any rate; and eſpecially man, that is inſpired with a reaſonable ſoule, whoſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion is its greateſt torment; and therefore delights not to be circumſcribed by any power, how juſt or mighty ſoever. But ſince it is my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny to fall under that misfortune, the world, I conceive could not have beſtowed upon my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a more gracious and noble Lord; and in that onely I reckon my ſelfe an object of envy to other inferiour Captives, not doubting, but my continued uſage, will not onely confirm me ſtill in the ſame beliefe, but oblige me both with thanks, and prayers, to expreſſe my gratitude for ſo high a favour.</p>
                  <p>This reply of the Princeſſe ſo well pleaſed the vaine humour of <hi>Oſirus,</hi> (imagining, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe underſtood not altogether his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet ſhe had will enough to comply with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:98927:97"/>his deſire) that inſtantly he commanded all the company out of the chamber; with an intention belike, to deliver his thoughts more freely unto her: but ſhe, neither knowing what he intended, nor was ever accuſtomed to be left alone with ſtrangers of a contrary ſex, preſently at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion grew ſo pale, that it was eaſily perceived by <hi>Oſirus,</hi> that her heart entertained ſome jealous feare of her honour; wherefore he cauſed <hi>Roxana</hi> to ſtay, not onely, as he ſaid, to be a wiſhed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to her Miſtreſſe, but a faithfull witneſſe of his own actions: and then turning up his mouchatos, as a preamble to his diſcourſe, as if he meant to gain by the poſture, a mightier e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of his perſon in <hi>Clorias</hi> opinion, converted his talke to her after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Lady, ſaid he, as the Gods can witneſſe the truth of my affection, ſo the world can give ſufficient teſtimony of my worth; and though, as Lord by my power, I might command; yet, as a ſlave, for your ſake, I am content to beg: beg (ſaid he) O you heavens, that I ſhould ſo deſcend! and ſmil'd ſcornfully with theſe words, as if he thought he had infinitely injured his greatneſſe, by the Courtſhip, however, he went on with this language; let it ſuffice, ſaid he, that mighty <hi>Oſirus</hi> loves the faireſt <hi>Cloria,</hi> a beauty onely worthy of that love, that Queenes have often coveted with ambition. But ſcarce had he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thus much, when a meſſenger in haſte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Chamber, and told him that young <hi>Philos,</hi> the Nephew of <hi>Philoſtros</hi> had lately given an abſolute ovethrow to the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Army, in a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:98927:97"/>ſet battell, and was now with expedition mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching towards the walls of <hi>Memphis;</hi> which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, as he ſaid, not onely required his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for direction, but his valour for prevention, ſince the danger appeared too evident.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oſirus,</hi> after ſome time of amazement, inſtead of conſideration, after he had a little put off his own diſtractions, told <hi>Cloria,</hi> that theſe were but trifling victories, to whet his invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to a ſharper revenge; and aſſured her, his next preſent ſhould be <hi>Philos</hi> head laid at her feet, as the true witneſſe of his valour, inſtead of a more proper Sacrifice to the proſperity of their future loves. And as he continued theſe rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montodos, hee was intercepted by the whole aſſembly of the City, who informed him it was no time to be amorous, when <hi>Memphis</hi> was in apparent danger to be loſt; which abruptly pluckt him away from his bragging Courtſhip, to the infinite content of poore <hi>Cloria;</hi> ſuppoſing her ſelfe hy this means, freed from the plague of her thoughts, ſince ſhe imagined, this accident would give <hi>Oſirus</hi> endeavours ſufficient imployment, and hinder him from entertaining his fancies, with thoſe deſires ſhe was reſolved he ſhould never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Yet <hi>Roxana,</hi> apprehending ſtill a dark cloud of trouble to hang over their heads, by reaſon of <hi>Oſirus</hi> ſeeming paſſion, or at leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended love; after a grave ſilence, in reproofe of <hi>Cloria's</hi> too much joy, gave her Miſtreſſe advice in this ſort, the better to prepare her againſt another encounter.</p>
                  <p>Although this hatefull Lover, ſaid ſhe, be a
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98927:98"/>torment to your thoughts, and his expreſſions be no other then treaſons againſt the love you beare <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> yet, ſuch is the neceſſity of the time, and the power of your captivity, that either you muſt force your will to comply with <hi>Oſirus,</hi> if he proſecute his affections, or diſſemble ſo farre your intentions, as to give him ſome hope of your conſent; for it is not to be doubted, but this Prince is as high in his pride, as mighty in his command, which may at laſt fly to a deſperate requitall, if he ſhould be any way ſcornfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; ſince it is evident, his people have taken notice of his endeavours, not onely by the firſt propoſition, which was the occaſion of your Grandmothers journey into <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſo much exaſperated your fathers ſubjects; but in his now intimation of his deſires, before his ſervants, with ſuch extravagant vain glory; and how eaſie it is for him to have pretexts for any cruelty he ſhall uſe, may bee conſidered in theſe particulars; Firſt, for your fathers diſdainfull refuſing of his Aunt, after the marriage was in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and laſtly the loſſe he ſuſtained upon the <hi>Ionian</hi> ſhoare, by the deſtruction of the ſuppoſed invincible Fleet, he ſent to reduce <hi>Cyprus</hi> again under his obedience. Wherefore be aſſured, if you diſgrace him by an abſolute refuſall, he will ſtrive to diſhonour you by an equall violence, when both the object and the opportunity give him the occaſion, not to be avoided by your induſtry; and love, when it is once converted into hate, by contrary accidents, procures for the moſt part, ſad and diſmall examples of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98927:98"/>ſince the paſſions, as they are moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, ſo are they equally violent, and one ſeeking to drive out another, cannot but produce ſtrong operations, like the nature of Lightning or Earthquakes, that doe not onely contend moſt forcibly againſt obſtacles, but are ingendred meerly by diſſentions amongſt the elements. Wherefore, my opinion is, that for the preſent you give way to the fury of his flames, if love be the occaſion of his Courtſhip; which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſdeined, but gently tempered, may in time be qualified, eſpecially when thoſe great buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes he hath now in hand, ſhall draw away his thoughts to more neceſſary imployments. And if it be pride that ſwels up his reſolutions to make you his wife, becauſe he will not be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any thing he ſhall demand, certainly the humor muſt not be reſiſted, untill you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to free your ſelfe from his juriſdiction, which perhaps may quickly be effected by the iſſue of theſe warres; in the mean time your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſeeming eſtimation of his worth, will abate the vanity of thoſe fumes, when it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, by ſome diſſembling, complements you may uſe, you are ſo farre off from contemning his offered affection, that you doe not think your ſelfe worthy of the honour; however, you cannot want excuſes to protract his haſty deſires, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring leaſure, not onely to render you an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute lover of his perſon, as well as the admirer of his greatneſſe; but alſo, to ſend to your friends, as a neceſſary circumſtance belonging to your duty and modeſty, whoſe conſents you muſt not ſeem
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:98927:99"/>to doubt, ſince the alliance conduces ſo much to your advantage; however, the frantick people of <hi>Lydia</hi> ſeemed ſo ſtubbornly to oppoſe the firſt propoſitions; All which probably will ſatisfie him for the preſent, and winne time, till either the ſiege conſtraine him to render you, with the Town into the hands of <hi>Orſames</hi> your uncle; or the gods by ſome other means, be mercifully pleaſed to provide conveniencies for your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape.</p>
                  <p>However, <hi>Cloria</hi> was ſcarce contented with counſell, whereby to ſhew her ſelfe ſo great an hypocrite in her love; yet the warre, in the mean time, took up the imployments of <hi>Oſirus,</hi> that he had not leiſure, or at leaſtwiſe will to importune the Princeſſe, to her no ſmall ſatisfaction; for he endeavoured by frequent ſallies to hinder the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the enemy, which brought on oft-times, moſt bloody and deſperate encounters; wherein the particular valours of many brave Knights appeared to the worlds admiration: This not onely continued the ſiege with a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full expectation, but at laſt compelled <hi>Orſames</hi> in perſon, with a new power to ſtrengthen his party; <hi>Oſirus,</hi> after he had valiantly defended the Town for ſome moneths, reſolved by a generall ſally, either to diſlodge the <hi>Syrians</hi> from being ſo neere a neighbour to the walls, or to periſh in the attempt. Wherefore, one night, having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acquainted the chiefe Commanders with his deſigne, and given a falſe alar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Philoſtros</hi> quarters, with ſo much violence and courage, that he not onely committed a ſlaughter worthy of ſuch a reſolution, but had infallibly taken the Favourite priſoner, if he had not been prevented, by the valour of a Knight in white ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, who defended his tent with ſo much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, that both his forces were repulſed, and himſelfe in danger to be ſlaine, ſince he loſt his head-piece in the conflict: which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding added wings to the fierceneſſe of the fight; for both parties, enflamed with the deſire of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, the one to make good the progreſſe they had induſtriouſly made in the <hi>Syrian</hi> Army; and the other to regain what they had, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſhamefully loſt, appeared deſperate of their lives; the horrour was alſo increaſed by the darkneſſe of the night, leaving no conveniency for defence; and this, in like manner became aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, by the accidentall burning of <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe accidents called forth, in a manner, the whole power of <hi>Memphis;</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ſiege had been finiſhed, by the ſeeming ſucceſſe of their party, leaving onely the women in the interim to guard the walls: but <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> finding the deſperate condition of the Kings Army, if a prevailing reſiſtance were not made; when he had ſecured <hi>Orſames</hi> perſon by a ſtrong guard, he commanded upon pain of death, that no man ſhould imploy his endeavours to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the fire in the Camp, ſince, as he thought, it had been kindled by ſome traytors in the army,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98927:100"/>to give his ſouldiers imployment, whilſt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy might become victorious; yet he promiſed them all reparation in their loſſes, after they had valiantly repulſed the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> who, as hee ſaid, were but a handfull of men in compariſon of <hi>Orſames</hi> powerfull Army: with theſe words, &amp; the aſſembly of many brave Troops to attend upon his perſon, he ſuddenly aſſailed <hi>Oſirus,</hi> as it were triumphing in his ſucceſſe, in ſo much as he was forced to give back, with a greater ſlaughter then was convenient for his purpoſe, or the defence of the Town, though he ſuppoſed that night to have made an end of the ſiege; for finding that not onely his expectation was deceived, but his fortunes began to change, he cauſed the retreat to be ſounded, the rather becauſe the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day, as he conceived, would endanger the loſſe of his whole forces, ſince the enemy farre out-numbred his power, having no diſadvantage but the night ſeaſon. <hi>Oſiris,</hi> being again retired within the walls of <hi>Memphis,</hi> and having taken a generall muſter of his people: by which he found himſelfe uncapable of more ſallies, he reſolved from thence forward, onely to defend the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, with his beſt policy; whilſt in the mean time, <hi>Orſames</hi> alſo fell to the ſpade: which not only proved ſomething tedious to many brave ſpirits of both ſides, but gave occaſion of divers private combats, wherein were performed acts of honour and delight; though it was noiſed in the Town, the white Knight that had diſarmed <hi>Oſirus,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be the moſt perfect Cavaliere.</p>
                  <p>The Princeſs <hi>Cloria,</hi> that had now a long time
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:98927:100"/>been happily freed from the unpleaſant Courtſhip of <hi>Oſirus,</hi> retired for her more delight one day into a private Gallery belonging to her own lodgings, which was furniſhed with ſo many rare pieces, that the diverſity of objects, could not but give imployment and recreation to the moſt dull eyes, much more to thoſe that were beautified with ſo much naturall curioſity, as hers were: ſhe had not before this had any knowledge of the place, being onely perſwaded thither by the importunity of a ſeeming officious ſervant, that belike had onely the protection of the room; who preſently notwithſtanding left her alone, to converſe privately with her own delights. The firſt picture proved a ſubject for her ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, for it was the dolefull repreſentation of the Story of <hi>Philomela's</hi> raviſhment, by her unnaturall and cruell brother in law; wherein ſhe not onely with two or three ſad ſighs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to compaſſionate the injured Lady; but with a little apprehenſion, reflected upon her own ſtate, being alſo in the power of an inflamed Lover; whilſt ſhe remained, as it were, tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with diverſity of thoughts, that were capable to diſquiet the gentle boſome of a young virgin, of a ſudden ſhe might heare one to unlock a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſecret doore behind her, which till then ſhe had not perceived to be in that part of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; ſo that the feares that formerly had been ingendred in her imagination by the pittifull object ſhe beheld, encreaſed in her being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of company; and this gave her, as ſhe believed, not onely cauſe to wiſh her ſelfe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:98927:101"/>In her own chamber, but to be abſolutely ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of her preſent ſafety, ſince ſhe knew not well where ſhe was; though her terror was grounded upon no other reaſon, then ſuch as children uſe to have when they goe in the dark, imagining every noyſe to be ſome frightfull thing. But long ſhe had not expected the iſſue, in the mean time making haſte to the doore where ſhe had entered, but ſhe became diſtractedly ſatisfied, of what ſhe moſt doubted; for <hi>Oſirus</hi> appeared ſuddenly to her view, like ſome horrid viſion; apparrelled in black, that threa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Princeſs, as I ſaid, thus ſurprized, by him ſhe moſt feared, when ſhe thought her ſelfe freeſt from all interruption, it was a queſtion whether doubt or amazement layed ſtrongeſt hold of her ſenſes; though the laſt paſſion at length obtained the greater prerogative, by her too much conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; ſo that ſhe remained like <hi>Pigmalions</hi> beautifull image, that wanted both life and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Thus fixed ſhe ſtood, untill <hi>Oſirus</hi> (after ſome time of ſeeming admiration of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which he uſed as a fitting complement) began to make his addreſſes, as to a faire ſtatue; but ſhe, as it were, carried onely with a certain inſtinct of hatred, or at leaſtwiſe diſlike, (ſince for the preſent ſhe had loſt her chiefe faculties o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In this manner they continued, untill poore <hi>Cloria</hi> had loſt that breath, that ſhould have ſtill defended her from being made a proy to his intended Courtſhip: but he now having her in his abſolute poſſeſſion, firſt arreſted her by the faire hand, as a teſtimony he had a further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to impart unto her, and then began to entertain her eares with amorous language, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it was the worſt charme he could uſe, to bring her within the compaſſe of his Circle; wherefore, before he could utter many words upon that unwelcome theame (in witneſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that, preſently taking her in his armes, almoſt diſtracted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his own love and her danger, hee never left tormenting her in that manner, untill he had again brought her in ſome ſort to her ſelfe, which made her look upon him with thoſe two admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable lights, (though yet they had not recovered their former luſtre) as if ſhe accuſed his cruelty, for this laſt part of his care, in ſeeking to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her life, more then for the former act of her unjuſt impriſonment, ſince ſhe conceived his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was onely to reſerve her for a worſe end; and then preſently ſhut them again, as if ſhe both feared, and loathed his ſight; withall uttering theſe words, that ſhe hoped the gods would yet protect her innocent honour againſt his wilde l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However, before his departure, to ſet up trophees of his own conceived victory, he imprinted a hated kiſſe upon her ſweet lips, which ſhe received no otherwiſe, then as ſome loathſome potion drunke, to avoyd a dangerous diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Oſirus</hi> had thus abſolutely quitted the lodgings, to the Princeſſe privacy, ſhe began too ſeriouſly to reflect upon her own miſfortunes, ſince the ſtrength of her apprehenſion, dreſt all her conſiderations in mourning apparell: in the firſt place, ſhe ſeemed moſt bitterly to accuſe her ſelfe of ingratitude, to the deare love of deſerving <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> ſince like a coward, ſhe durſt not own it, before the face of any power: next, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhe curſt her ſelfe, for having given any hope at all to the proud thoughts of her hatefull Gao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, as ſhe eſteemed <hi>Oſirus;</hi> not knowing, by any means, how to wind her diſſimulation out of the engagement; untill at laſt, with the very imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of what ſhe had done, (although in truth ſhe had done nothing) ſhe was tranſported ſo much beyond all patience, that ſhe ſeemed in a manner diſtracted, out of a certain jealouſie, that ſhe had yeelded to ſome thing, that might deſtroy
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:98927:106"/>her former love, and oblige her to a ſecond: yet ſhe had ſo much incompaſſionate ſenſe left, as to be her own cruell tormenters ſometimes tearing her haire, and then again beating her Alabaſter breſt, as if ſhe meant to puniſh her ſelfe, for having but onely cozened <hi>Oſirus</hi> vain imagination. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether tyred with theſe diverſities of paſſions, which again brought her to that temper, that ſhe was in ſome kind capable of profitable conſideration, ſhe began to gather up the ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red remnants of her torn attire, and by the help of a Glaſſe there preſent, ſhe a little accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her own diſcompoſure, not out of any curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſhe deſired to uſe towards her perſon, but onely to prevent the diſcovery of her diſcontents, not knowing how ſoon again ſhe might be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized. And thus, after ſhe had performed what ſhe thought was moſt neceſſary, to re-edifie what ſhe had unframed by her violence, ſhe went and ſat down in the Chaire, leaning her head, over the back, with both her hands faſtned upon her knee, whilſt in the mean time her eyes were filled with teares, and her looks ſtedfaſtly fixed upwards, as if ſhe implored the Heavens ayd in her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes: thus ſhe remained, untill <hi>Roxana,</hi> by the direction of <hi>Oſirus</hi> ſervant, was brought into the Gallery, to accompany her miſtris; which <hi>Cloria</hi> notwithſtanding perceived not, till both the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was gone, and <hi>Roxana</hi> ſeeing her ſad poſture, approached to waken her out of her ſadneſſe; ſo that at laſt, by the importunity of two or three calls, the almoſt dead Princeſs ſeemed by a ſlow motion to take new life, like a young <hi>Phoenix,</hi>
                     <pb n="203" facs="tcp:98927:106"/>after her mothers obſequies; and when ſhe had ſent forth a couple of deep ſights, as aſſured meſſengers of her inward ſorrow, being ſtill preſt by <hi>Roxana,</hi> to know the cauſe of her diſcontent, (for ſhe was an intire ſtranger to the encounter between her and <hi>Oſirus</hi>) ſhe at laſt told her, ſhe had been lately tormented by a hatefull fury, and if by her wiſdome ſhe could not be diſ-ingaged from the inchantment, ſhe was afraid it had got ſo much poſſeſſion of her perſon, that it muſt needs turn her reſolutions to the forſaking of what ſhe moſt affected, or abſolutely deſtroy that life ſhe was willing to preſerve, becauſe her friends wiſhed it. This diſtracted language, and unuſuall looks, made <hi>Roxana</hi> the more eager to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Wherefore, after <hi>Cloria</hi> had invited her to ſit down by her, ſhe informed her particularly of all the paſſages between her ſelfe and <hi>Oſirus,</hi> yet vowing ſhe would die a thouſand deaths, rather then yeeld to his deſire; withall, blaining her for having been the occaſion of her diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>However, theſe paſſions drew from the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſome teares; yet, preferring a diſcreet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, before a fruitleſſe compaſſion, ſhe not only ſoon dryed her eyes, but ſpake to her after this manner: Moſt deare Lady and Miſtris, ſaid ſhe, although I could be content to bewaile the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion that firſt wound you into this labyrinth of difficulties, yet it were meerly ridiculous to lament that which is paſt, without attempting the means to be delivered from the miſchiefe: Wherefore, before I proceed to counſell (however
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98927:107"/>I ſhall be content to take upon me what blame you pleaſe) I think it not amiſſe a little to let you ſee your own errour, whereby you may be rendred more capable of advice; for yet your deſpairing thoughts take from you all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of receiving other impreſſions, then impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities of prevention, which certainly will be the laſt and worſt deſperation, if tyrannicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice abſolutely prevaile, though I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the gods will never permit ſo high an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, if you your ſelfe provoke not too much their wrath, by having leſſe truſt in their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then you ought to have. In the firſt place, be pleaſed to conſider, what greater inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you now undergoe, then if you had inflamed <hi>Oſirus,</hi> by your peremptory deniall? ſince the dangerous effects of that refuſall, can but fall upon you, when all other waies have been attempted for your preſervation and delivery; whereas now, you have not onely purchaſed time, that may produce happy accidents, but alſo by it you have convenient leiſure to think upon many things for your benefit, that have not yet fallen, perhaps, within the compaſſe of your conſideration. In ſo much, as I muſt needs, not onely approve of your diſcretion, in tempering your love to <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus,</hi> and concealing your hate to <hi>Oſirus,</hi> but doe further counſell you; nay, muſt conjure you, that if the Prince doe again importune you for your conſent, which no doubt he will, that you ſeem to give your free approbation, for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture marriage; nevertheleſſe, upon this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it may be kept ſecret from any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98927:107"/>untill you have ſent to your mother into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> to have her allowance; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe cannot binde at all, not onely in reſpect of your former obligation to <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> but alſo in regard you are priſoner, and therefore not tied to any contract made in ſuch a ſtate; which, as I ſaid before, will gain time (the moſt precious thing we can deſire, beſides your abſolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) untill either the winning of the Town by the beſiegers, probable enough (ſince <hi>Soraſtros</hi> is ſo imployed in his <hi>Carthagenian</hi> warres, that he cannot ſend any ſuccours to relieve his ſonne) or ſome other fortunate chance give a period to your unfortunate intanglement; in the meane ſpace, if my wits faile me not, I may project ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for your advantage. And thus by faire words, with her diſcrect carriage, <hi>Cloria</hi> by little and little was perſwaded to reſt ſatisfied; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that <hi>Oſirus</hi> imployment in the ſiege, gave her ſome weeks reſpit from his importunity.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Oſirus</hi> one day, either over-hot with his affection, or conceiving he had permitted <hi>Cloria</hi> a ſufficient time of conſideration, came into the ſame Gallery, where ſhe was again privately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired for her receation; who, after ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained his ſhort complements, with a pale countenance, and a trembling expreſſion, the true wineſſes of her troubled mind, he began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand an account of her reſolutions; ſince, as he ſaid, he had given her both a noble and a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reſpit, and therefore wiſhed her no longer to play the tyrant with his love. <hi>Cloria,</hi> when ſhe had a little recollected her diſtracted ſpirits,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98927:108"/>became ſomething paſſionate of his peremptory taxation, hoping thereby the better to obtaine a longer protraction of her determinate anſwer for the marriage; but he ſeeming to preſſe it, with ſome violence, the Princeſſe took the boldneſſe to tell him, that although ſhe intended not to diſpute the queſtion between his love and her tyranny, much leſſe to examine the graciouſneſſe of his proceedings; yet ſince ſhe was reſolved to have more time, before ſhe could fully conſent to a buſineſſe of ſo high a conſequence, ſhe deſired him to have the patience which befitted a ſuitor: This ſhe delivered with a quick ſharpneſſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to her cuſtome, that ſhewed, ſhe was not more diſpleaſed with his requeſt, then confident of her power.</p>
                  <p>Yet alas, the laſt opinion extreamly deceived her; for <hi>Oſirus</hi> belike, diſdaining in his proud nature, to entertain any thing from his Captive, but humilicy, with a ſowre brow told her, that thoſe ſparkles which hier beauty had kindled in his heart, were either to be kept alive by more violence, or to be utterly extinguiſhed, by a juſt revenge; and theſe words put poore <hi>Cloria</hi> clean beſide all her policy; ſo that ſhe ſtood ſome time, like one that ſaw a ſpirit, and had not courage enough to ſpeak to it; which was an occaſion that they both entertained one another for a pretty ſpace, with their lookes onely; untill the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of feare dictated to her thoughts a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of redeeming again his good opinion, doubting her too much confidence had endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in ſome ſort, his diſpleaſure; and therefore,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98927:108"/>with an humble courteſie, although her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſtill put on ſhews of diſtruſtfull averſion, ſhe thus ſpake unto him.</p>
                  <p>My Lord, ſaid ſhe, by your aſpect and words, I cannot but note your anger; which to my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is no leſſe to be eſteemed then abſolute deſtruction: ſince I can neither fly from your wrath, nor reſiſt your power; but how terrible that appeares to my imagination, when you are treating in matters of love, that ought to be ſweet and calme, I leave you to judge; when I am to be perpetually tyed to a ſubjection alwaies tyrannicall, and never converſable, as I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve by your preſent demeanour; ſince your jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and ſuſpitions, at this time, farre ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After ſhe had wiped her eyes, for now ſhe was to act her part, according to her Governeſſe direction, ſince ſhe found her other project had failed her, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan again to ſpeak to him in this manner; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe ſhewed, that her neceſſities had taught her a craft that was not at all in her nature, for that ſhee alwaies eſteemed it diſhonourable to diſſemble.</p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:98927:109"/>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid ſhe, if your profeſſions be anſwerable to my expectation, and that your thoughts goe along with your words, I ſhall be moſt happy in my declaration, ſince, as I am to be your wife with honour and content, as you have promiſed, ſo I muſt deſire you to permit thoſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without which they cannot be had; that is, that I may have liberty, before the publication of the Nupcials, to ſend into <hi>Cyprus</hi> to my mother, not onely to let her know what is become of me, but withall, to purchaſe her free conſent to ſo Noble a choyce; ſince, as you know, it is the leaſt duty of a childe, to give an account to their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of that diſpoſure, which abſolutely bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth them from their protection, and renders them ſubjects of another juriſdiction: wherein, you will not onely afford ſufficient proofe of your being hereafter a kind husband, but of your being now a Noble Conquerour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oſirus,</hi> although he was beyond expreſſion joy'd at her ſeeming conſent, and tickled to heare himſelfe magnified by a tongue he moſt valued; yet he was ſcarce pleaſed at the requeſt, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it neceſſarily protracted the marriage, as alſo, for that it raiſed ſome doubt, leſt <hi>Hyacin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia</hi> ſhould not be willing to the match; which made him for ſome time wreſtle with his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, untill at laſt, his over-weening fancy brought forth his judgement, in the two points controverttd by his ſuſpition; which was, that as in the firſt place he was bound in honour and love to give ſatisfaction to his now ſuppoſed wife; ſo for the other, he could not feare the diſlike of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:98927:109"/>the Queen, but rather a haſty conſent; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard it preſerved, but dignified her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: with this fance, and a ſmiling countenance, (which untill then he had never put on) he told <hi>Cloria,</hi> that her requeſt was granted; however, with this proviſo, that a meſſenger of his own, for the more ſtate, as he pretended, ſhould beare the Letter; wherein ſhe might very well ſee a continuance of his jealouſies, notwithſtanding his glorious profeſſions; though ſhe could not much blame him for the humour, ſince ſhee knew her own heart was not faithfull to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Cloria,</hi> however ſhe was ſorry for his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſhe was forced to give her conſent, like one that was conſtrained to deale with his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor after he was arreſted; and ſo the preſent bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine was ſtruck up between them, which ſhee thought commodious, in reſpect it procured her a reprieve, hoping that ere long the conſequence of the ſiege might produce accidents to her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Yet his telling her by chance, that his father <hi>Soraſtros,</hi> having compounded his <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> differences, was reſolved to march with his whole Army to relieve the Town, a little deſtroyed that hope; though he rather ſpoke it to ſatisfie his own vaunting humour, then out of any aſſurance he had of the deſigne. In this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture <hi>Oſirus,</hi> after he had endeavoured to ſhew his own amorous diſpoſition by a few love comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and with an ill grace, begg'd a kiſſe of her faire lips, he retired to entertaine his own joy, and pleaſe himſelfe with the fancies of his

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98927:110"/>that is the worſt of your expectation; beſides, you may remember, if you have not altogether forgot your own relation, how much he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered, when you did but mention, an incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in your reſolution of making him your husbands; in ſo much as you were glad your ſelfe to cry <hi>peceavi,</hi> and ſuddenly by diſſimulation to temper his paſſion. Yet, that you may ſee, I am not ſo great an enemy to your wiſhes, as your ſuſpition ſuggeſts to your imagination, I ſhall propound unto you probable remedies, if you have patience enough to put them in execution; if not, at leaſt wiſe ſit ſtill, and heare what I will act, without deſtroying my deſignes: Theſe words made poore <hi>Cloria</hi> perk up her ſelfe with a new hope, ſince ſhe could be never diffident in her Governeſſe wiſdome; and ſo by little and little, drew neerer unto her, till at laſt ſhe laid her head in the old womans boſome; whilſt ſhee had acquainted her with her project, in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>The boy, ſaid ſhe, which you ſaw us apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling when you entred into the chamber, (I hope ſent by the gods for our purpoſe) I bought, not long agoe, of a widdow to an <hi>AEthiopian</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, becauſe he could ſpeak perfectly the <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> tongue, and is by birth of <hi>Chios,</hi> brought up from his infancy in the art of ſwimming, as all the reſt of thoſe Iſlanders are; in ſo much as he is become admirable in that profeſſion, and was made uſe of by his dead maſter (who was a Jeweller by his vocation) for his commodity and gain in his traffick for rich ſtones, in reſpect the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:98927:111"/>rivers of theſe Countries yeeld abundance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, not being very certain of his skill before I had tried him in the water, and curious to be aſſured that my new ſervant wanted not that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of diving, according to the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (although I knew not what uſe I ſhould have of that ſcience) I carried him down into the deep ceſtern belonging to the Caſtle (which markes out yeerly the riſe and fall of <hi>Nilus</hi> to the people of the Countrey; whereby they may have a conjecture of the fertility of their harveſt) as conceiving it the moſt convenient place to prove his cunning; not onely in regard it lay within the limits of our own lodgings; but alſo, for that the deepneſſe of the poole would make a better proofe of his dexterity; where, not long he had plaid in the water, (I, in the mean time caſting in pieces of money, which he alwaies fetcht up from the bottom) before he fell by chance upon the great bolt that faſtens the Iron grate, giving paſſage into the Caſtle, that cannot be perceived, by reaſon of the ſtream, untill the courſe be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned another way, by certain artificiall pipes, that delivers it into the river, which before I was aware he unbolted, to have the more liberty in <hi>Nilus;</hi> but I ſoon called him into the Ceſterne againe, not onely becauſe I feared it might be diſcovered, but for that I began to think with my ſelfe, ſome benefit might be made of the knowledge: and to this purpoſe have conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, this boy may be ſent into your uncles army, not onely to give him notice of your impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but to try whether any brave ſpirits will
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98927:111"/>attempt the ſurprize of the Caſtle through the ſame paſſage, he upon their approach, opening the water-gate to give them entrance; which is a project not hard to be put in execution in the night ſeaſon, when the Guard ſhall be careleſſe of their watch, by reaſon the place is not at all ſuſpected. Beſides, I have noted ſo much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of that part of the Fort, that either it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, <hi>Oſirus</hi> wants Souldiers for the ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the whole Town; or, he conceives the Caſtle is inpregnable, of that ſide of <hi>Nilus:</hi> Now all the feare is, leaſt the boy himſelfe prove a traytor to the deſigne; which however can but ruine my ſelfe, and leave you in no worſe eſtate then you are; a ſacriſice I ſhall be alwaies content to offer, to render you the probability of ſo acceptable a ſervice: but if there cannot be found thoſe courages in the Camp, that will undergoe the danger of the attempt, the Dwarfe may have a further Commiſſion to paſſe into <hi>Cyprus</hi> to the Queen your mother, to inform her of all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages; by which information ſhe may uſe ſome means to protract her conſent to the marriage; or at leaſt wiſe, prevent <hi>Oſiris</hi> meſſengers returne, by cauſing him to be taken priſoner, before hee can get to the ſea-ſide.</p>
                  <p>No ſooner had <hi>Roxana</hi> laid open this ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, but <hi>Cloria,</hi> as if it had been already finiſhed, profeſt her Governeſſe the onely inſtrument of her happineſſe; (ſo far doth humane deſire goe beyond all judgement, governed by reaſon) though the politick old woman (notwithſtanding ſhe was willing to keep up her miſtreſſes hopes at

This enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize ſo farre pleaſed the Princeſſe, in the already ſucceſſe, that whilſt ſhe was dreſſing her ſelfe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a manner free from all care and perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by reaſon of the confidence ſhe had of the project; that ſhe deſired her Governeſſe, if ſhe knew the ſtory, to make her acquainted with the firſt occaſion of this warre between her uncle <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame,</hi> and <hi>Soraſtros</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> ſince, as ſhe ſaid, the ſpleen ſeemed to be irreconcileable.</p>

But however, this admirable eſteemed victory, both poſſeſſed the brave Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Town, and reduced many of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Nobility, to their lawfull obedience; yet the ſparcles of ſo great a diſunion, were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be buried in the Cinders of a quiet peace; eſpecially, ſince the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> neighbouring Countries were alwaies capable to kindle new flames, without ſome agreement by conſent; ſo that it was deſigned to uſe all means could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, to render the uncles contented; whereby the Prince might the better be ſecured, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in his rightfull inheritance, and the Country freed from the feare of any more civill warre; in proſecution of which, the one was bought with rich gifts, to become <hi>Orſames</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

                  <p>After that <hi>Oſirus</hi> had read the Letter, and for ſome time conſidered the contents thereof, with a diſdainfull ſmile he told the Meſſenger, that as he pardoned his raſhneſſe, for bringing ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory lines, to be preſented to a Majeſty, not to be diſcerned by ſo poore a ſight as his own; ſo he commanded him to let the boy know, not onely his owne contempt of his perſon, but that the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> (who was a wife rather fit for the gods, then for a child of ſo mean condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) diſdained the very mentioning of his love; wherein, he thought he much obliged her with a complement.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98927:117"/>to the gods, both for the proſperity of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the ſafety of <hi>Narciſſus</hi>) ſo, of the other ſide, <hi>Oſirus</hi> was more then buſied in the preparation, and encouragement of his ſouldiers; ſometime taking counſell, whether it were better to ſet upon the enemy, in the day, or the night; and how to manage the ſalley they intended to make, to the beſt advantage; other while, he cauſed falſe alarums to be given to the Camp, with beat of Drum and ſound of Trumpet, whereby the better not onely to deceive <hi>Orſames</hi> expectation, that he might be leſſe prepared, when he ſhould ſet upon him, but alſo to weary his ſouldiers, remaining in their armes; all which imployment took up the time; untill <hi>Oſirus</hi> (after two daies, in the dead of the night, ſo determined by a Councel of warre) iſſued forth, out of the Town, with moſt of his forces, onely leaving the burgers to man the walls; and marched in that manner ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, without any noyſe at all, the better to ſurprize the enemy. But contrary to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather to his extraordinary amazement, he found the Camp raiſed, and <hi>Orſames</hi> gone; onely ſome few left (as they confeſſed, being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the ſouldiers) to ſet fire to the Camp the next morning. This newes, as it gave ſufficient cauſe of wonder to <hi>Oſirus</hi> army, ſo it was quickly carried with joy into the Town; wherefore, the Troops returning again, after ſome ſlight ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were performed to the gods, every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to thoſe appetites that beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their ſenſualities; the Citizens onely taking care, as in time of peace, for the ſafety of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98927:117"/>City: but by this ſtrange; or rather ominous accdents, <hi>Clorias</hi> hopes ſeemed now to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely raviſhed, and her miſerable captivity to be eternally prolonged; nor had <hi>Roxana</hi> ſcarce cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage left her to comfort her ſorrowfull Miſtris in any kind, that could produce the leaſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering confidence; yet after they had ſpent the tedious day in diverlity of paſſions, which appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the more Tyrannicall, for that they were forced in part, to ſmother their griefes in their ſecret boſomes, that they might not come to the knowledge of thoſe ſpies, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to attend their perſons, if not ſecure their impriſonment; at night they both caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down upon their beds, without taking the paines to pull off their clothes, not believing that reſt they were probably to take, could merit the labour.</p>
                  <p>However they had not repoſed in that poſture much above two houres, in frightfull ſlumbers, and diſquiet dreames, engendred in their thoughts by deſpairing apprehenſions, when of the ſudden they were called up by a maid ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to behold a bloudy conflict in the Caſtle Hall, whereof they had the more commoditie to be ſpectators, in regard the window of the Wardrobe that belonged to their lodgings, had a full proſpect into the place; the fight ſeemed the more horrid, in regard onely of a faint light proceeding from a darke lampe, that was hung in the middle of the roome, which rather appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like the taper of death, ſince it was the means to ſhew the way to a greater ſlaughter, then was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:98927:118"/>commodious, or at all delightfull to the view: but after a while that the confuſed combatants either wearied by over much diſtruction, or the prevailing party having gained too apparent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage over thoſe of the Caſtle, (in part to be diſcerned by their Livery) began to breath, whilſt the others fled, either to ſeeke more helpe, or to ſave their lives; yet long they had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed that repoſe, (and I may ſay in ſome ſort neceſſary) but they might here a Knight among the reſt, that ſeemed to be the chiefe Captaine of the Company in Command, to blame them for their ſlothfulneſſe in proſecution, conſidering as he ſaid, the work was not halfe done, untill they were full poſſeſſors of the Fort; with theſe words flouriſhing a little his ſword about his head, he endeavoured to make a new paſſage into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt roomes; but long it was not before he was ſtrongly oppoſed by a guard at the doore, that couragiouſly denied him entrance, untill many of their lives had paid for the bold attempt. This brought <hi>Oſiris</hi> ready armed to warrant his guards Commiſſion; So that the knight was forced to retire back into the hall, not ſo much to give way to the fury of his ſtroake, as perceiving him to be the Prince by his owne language, to have the more ſpace conveniently to fight in the Hall, ſince he found himſelfe ſhut up in a ſtraight entry: never till then began a combat worth the beholding; for, as <hi>Oſiris</hi> ſeemed to contend, for the defence of his Caſtle, knowing them by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be <hi>Orſames</hi> Souldiers, ſo the Captaine, as it were by the provocation of honour, ſtrived by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98927:118"/>force of Armes to make him his priſoner, being the chiefe Prince of the Countrey; ſince the glory of the victory appeared, onely to conſiſt in ſuch a conqueſt as himſelf beleeved; whilſt in the meane time his other followers purſued the reſt of the guard round about the Fort, untill they had abſolutely rendred them ſubjects of their wrath, or objects of their mercy; and thus continued theſe confuſed ſlaughters, and fearefull cryes of dying and veilding perſons, to the aſtoniſhment of poore <hi>Cloria,</hi> whoſe eyes had not beene often acquainted with ſuch ſpectacles, till the dwarfe <hi>Roxana</hi> had ſent to informe <hi>Orſames</hi> of their Captivity, appeared ſuddenly at their backes, and almoſt as ſoon informed them, not onely of the ſucceſſe of his enterprize in the Army, but withall told them, that it was <hi>Narciſſus</hi> that for the preſent combated with <hi>Oſiris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then the Princeſſe began again to be poſſeſſed with ſome new feares, as doubting the iſſue of the fight, ſince ſhee beheld both their armours alike beſprinkled with bloud, which cauſed her a little to withdraw her ſight; by the interpoſition of a certaine curtaine that covered the windows; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever not being able long, to withhold her curious though diſtracted lookes, from that fearful object as ſhee conceived, after ſome more time looking againe into the hall, ſhe might behold <hi>Oſiris</hi> fall downe, before the conquering ſword of brand <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who preſently notwithſtanding made haſt to him with ſeeming wings of charity and compaſſion, and ſoone unlaced his Head-plece, with intention to give him ſome refreſhing ayre,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98927:119"/>as the moſt neceſſary meanes, to call him againe out of his founding, that appeared to his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion the next neighbour unto death: <hi>Oſiris</hi> after he had recovered a new life by this courteſie, fixed his eyes ſtedfaſtly upon him, as if however in a manner, he diſdained all aſſiſtance in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; untill at laſt in an appearing paſſion, he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe words: Is it poſſible the gods can thus envy my fate, as not onely to make me a baſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in my owne Caſtle, but to neceſſitate my fortunes to ſuch a condition, as to render me needfull of an enemies favour? nay, rather ſaid he, let me dye a thouſand times in the height of your cruelties, and my owne misfortune; then preſently ſhut his eyes againe, as if he hated the dayes light, though as it mighe be thought, more for his conceived diſgrace to be ſo overcome, then for the loſſe of his liberty and proſperity; however <hi>Narciſſus</hi> commanded his Officers, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to beare the wounded Prince to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, without any other reply, then that his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required patience and not paſſion; which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely made up the full period of his fortunate glory, to the amazed content of his moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full love: but <hi>Cloria</hi> being perſwaded by <hi>Roxana,</hi> to give <hi>Narciſſus</hi> a viſit in the Hall, ſince that was the honourable Theater, where he had acted ſo valiant a part for her delivery, ſhee haſted in her reſolutions to that wiſhed entertainment, which diverted other conſiderations; however <hi>Narciſſus</hi> not ſo cold in his love to his faire Miſtreſſe, after he had diſpoſed of <hi>Oſirus</hi> to ſafe cuſtody, with a ſtrict command for his noble uſage, and a diligent
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98927:119"/>care to be had of his wounds, made what haſte he could up into the Princeſſe chamber, as to the Temple where he intended to offer his firſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice after his Victories, which was the occaſion they both met upon the ſtaires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Narciſſus</hi> when he beheld the onely Goddeſſe of his heart, had much adoe to abſtaine from open Idolatry; however, his congue could not forbeare theſe expreſſions, when he had ſealed his owne welcome, with his longing lips upon her white hand: Moſt excellent Princeſſe, ſaid he, the onely hope of my life, and the very life of all my hopes, whoſe goodneſſe and beauty are ſuch parallels of perfection, that heaven and earth ſeeme to have conſpired in your Birth, ſince by the one you conquer the world, as by the other you do more then prevaile with the divine powers: And yet ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> you ſeemed to challenge a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in my love, when you durſt expreſſe in your Letter to <hi>Oſirus,</hi> your intereſt to my perſon and affection, in ſo bold a ſtile and language, without my privacy and allowance, which might have coſt me deare, if your fortune had not beene better then your temper. At which reproofe <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> (fearing he had exaſperated the Princeſſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by that declaration) began with trembling and diſtracted words, to make an apology for that preſumption: But mercifull <hi>Cloria,</hi> when ſhee had conducted him into her owne chamber, and there for ſome time entertained him with a pretty ſmile; onely enjoyned him for his pennance, the relation of his adventures, ſince ſhee left him at her mothers Court, in the habit of <hi>Aminta:</hi> yet
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98927:120"/>conſidering what a diſcovery, unawares ſhee had made to <hi>Roxana</hi>'s knowledge, ſhee could not chuſe but grow red, whileſt her Governeſſe look't her in the face with ſome wonder, to heare of the name of <hi>Aminta</hi> her owne ſervant, and <hi>Narciſſus</hi> her miſtreſſe lover to be the ſame perſon; This made the Princeſſe bluſh with the more violence, till at laſt the riddle was unfolded by her ſelfe, ſince it could not be any longer kept ſecret; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with a conjuration to her Governeſſe, never to divulge it to any perſon living. But having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed all theſe differences, at laſt <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> whom ſhee onely blamed for the act, began his ſtory in this manner:</p>
                  <p>After ſaid he the newes of your ſtrange loſſe, was ſpread through your Mothers Coart, and ſo conſequently over all the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which left no corner without griefe and ſorrow, I reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved preſently to change my diſguiſe, and ſearch you in every place, that could afford any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of your aboade; And firſt it came into my imagination, that you might be voluntarily retired into <hi>Lydia,</hi> to accompany your Father in his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities; however that was but a fancy to all knowing judgements, ſince you would before the determination, have made the Queene acquainted with your reſolution, who rather believed that ſome love conſpiracy betweene us two, had made you privately quit the Countrey: but as both I and others ſuppoſed we knew not what, ſo I went I knew not where, till at laſt by a rough Journey at Sea, I arrived upon the Coaſt of <hi>Caria,</hi> with an intention to enquire whether or no, you made
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98927:120"/>your aboade in your Fathers Court, however I was before-hand convinced in the improbability of the demand, where nevertheleſſe by chance, I met with a ſhip of thoſe Pirates, that had fled from the reſt that tooke you priſoner, not being conſenting to your tranſportation into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which was put into that Harbour, with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they could not be admitted ſpeedily into the ſervice of <hi>Evarchus</hi> againſt his owne Subjects, who had already as 'twas reported imployed moſt of his royall Navy againſt his Command, they would direct their courſe to <hi>Tyre,</hi> to make the ſame offer to <hi>Orſames</hi> your Uncle; by which meanes I became abſolutely informed of them, of all thoſe paſſages that concerned your Perſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Pirates before your comming to <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis:</hi> but they receiving a refuſall, by reaſon the King your Father eſteemed not himſelfe, yet ready for their aſſiſtance, I determined to take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of that ſhip for my tranſportation into <hi>Syria:</hi> however, becauſe the Veſſell needed ſome reparation before it could goe out of the Haven of <hi>Caria,</hi> I had ſufficient leiſure given me in a diſguiſe, to informe my ſelfe of the aſſaires of your Father, as a duty belonging to you, whom as I was told had lately quitted the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> and was retired for his greater ſecurity (though with a very few company) to <hi>Theatira,</hi> a place as it was conceived much more addicted to his ſervice; upon my arrivall I found him in a condition in that City beyond my expectation, not onely attended by moſt of the Gentry and Nobility of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but going to a great Aſſembly of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98927:121"/>people gathered together by his command; unto whom he made an oration to this purpoſe:</p>
                  <p>My Lords ſaid he, and you the reſt of my Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as I am not more glad, to ſee this joyfull Declaration of your Duties to my Service, then willing to imploy my beſt endeavours for your protection, ſo I hope the Gods will give me the power ſtill to be your King, notwithſtanding the cunning and malicious practices of many, who have ſought to bereave me of that honour, alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging I have a will rather to become a tyrant, then continue a Governour: but for that this meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is principally deſigned, that you may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know me, and I be more aſſured of you, I ſhall ſtrive to let you ſee my acts and thoughts: in the firſt place, no ſooner was I throughly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of the grievances of my Kingdomes, but I aſſembled the great Councell to give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe, wherein I not onely condeſcended to paſſe ſuch decrees, as were thought neceſſary for that purpoſe, but aſſured the continuance thereof, abſolately to bury all feares and jealouſies, that might ariſe by reaſon of any doubt of my incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; however this is now ſo farre turned to my diſadvantage, that I am not onely denyed, any more mannaging the affaires of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, contrary to the known Lawes of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but have been in a manner, forcibly driven from <hi>Sardis</hi> my regall City, with diſorderly tumults; neither can probably be again eſtabliſhed in my ancient right, without your aſſiſtance. In the ſecond place, I can give you no ſtronger aſſurance, then my deep vowes to the gods, that I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98927:121"/>change the laws, cuſtoms, and religion of the Kingdome, which are teſtimonies ſufficient for your beliefe, againſt calumniations, and falſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſions, caſt about in your eares to my prejudice; ſince in your loves I mean rather to rule, then by my own Sword, And now I ſhall proceed to let you ſee, the danger to your ſelves by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended change of Lawes; though, before you can be entirely inſtructed therein, you muſt be throughly informed of the conſtitutions of your own preſent government, the beſt compoſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all other, ſince it is a Monarch of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, that it neither takes from the King, that power that is neceſſary for his obedience; nor yet leaves the ſubject in a ſlaviſh ſubjection; ſo that if he would, he cannot be a Tyrant; and if he will, he may be a Prince: in the one, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are invited to obey with love; and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Soveraigne is compelled to govern with humanity, ſince he hath not power to be over-inſolent, as the ſubject liberty to be licentious; in ſo much as there will now reſt nothing, but to mark out to your underſtandings my Priviledges and your rights, whereby you may the more clearly diſtinguiſh, of the unhappy differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and my Senate; which as I take it, is the plaineſt way of demonſtration, ſince the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is brought into fact, and not left to opinion.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe, I challenge, by the lawes, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and fundamentall conſtitutions of this Kingdome, never yet contradicted, or diſputed by any time, the creating of Nobility, ordaining officers, pardoning offenders, confiſcations of

So that, I ſay, as theſe were moſt laudable conſtitutions, conveyed unto you by the wiſdome of your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, ſo doe not you by your own ſtupid wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, (for no better can I call it) endeavour to aboliſh that excellent government, that hath continued you happy for ſo many ages; reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the <hi>Giants,</hi> that made a prepoſterous warre with heaven, untill they and their proud endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, were all buried in a confuſed deſtruction. I ſpeak not this, that I ſo much doubt you in your affections, as I feare others in their ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for as no hypocriſie is ſo dangerous, as that which brings with it the name of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſo no bait is ſo catching, as that which is ſweetned with the promiſe of liberty. Remember but your paſt delight, and compare it with the preſent diſtraction, and I am aſſared you will finde a difference; wherefore if theſe be but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of evils, conſider what the end will be; alterations of government are like deſperate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that at the beſt exceedingly diſtemper, and at the worſt are deadly: if you ſhould have more freedome then you have, you would but break your windes, before you get to the end of your courſe; and if you have leſſe then you enjoy, may the Gods puniſh me for my tyranny; let your old law-markes guide you in your ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98927:124"/>and obedience, and ſuffer no new ones to be ſet up, that will not teach you to void rocks, ſince you are not acquainted with their ſtations. That ſubject muſt needs be in great ſlavery, that neither knows a certain rule whereby to doe well, nor can comprehend the power of the Lord he is to obey: let the things you know be your puniſhment or reward, by which you may eaſily ſquare your endeavours, and not bring a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon your ſelves, for that you cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly learne; ſince it will not be your crime that condemns you, but other opinions that judges you. But perchance it may be alleaged, that this unlimited juriſdiction is to laſt but during the neceſſity of the time; unto which it may as probably be anſwered, that as any new authority obtained, is ſeldome or never given over, but by force; ſo, of the other ſide, it is more then ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious there is no ſuch intention, when the old way is ſufficient to govern moderately by, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking a new, by injurious difficulties; no, no, be not deceived, for ſcarce yet a change hath been made in any State (under what pretentions ſoever) that ever it came to the ſame form again, notwithſtanding ſomething plauſible at the firſt, was offered to the people, to procure it the fairer paſſage. In a word I muſt confeſſe, your liberty is as convenient as my prerogative, and without which neither of both can be happy: Wherefore let us reſolve, that neither the one nor the other, ſhall be deſtroyed by violence or craft; and as I will never ſtretch my juriſdiction to prejudice you, ſo doe not you abaſe your own liberty to deſtroy your ſelves.</p>

                  <p>But however the Kings ſpeech was variouſly interpreted by the multitude, who were bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the deſires of equality, yet the Gentry and Nobility, put on ſuch ſtrong reſolutions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your fathers rights, ſince upon that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the honour of their own dignities, that in a ſhort time, as I have been ſince informed, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſter of a brave Army, commanded by his own Nephew, called <hi>Thyaſmus,</hi> younger brother to Prince <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> who had been taken priſoner by the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> in ſeeking to revenge, or rather maintaine his dead fathers quarrell; from whence after ſome time of Noble impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, he was releaſed without any other ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, then that he ſhould never during his life beare Armes againſt <hi>Artaxes;</hi> which was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he being of a reſtleſſe ſpirit, that he ſought imployment in his uncles ſervice, and by reaſon of theſe new troubles hath obtained it.

This diſcoverie inflamed my ſoul with ſo much jealouſie, that I begg'd leave of
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98927:125"/>
                     <hi>Orſames</hi> to ſend the fooliſhchalleng, that ſeemed to claim an intereſt in your affections, for which I hope I have already received my full correction. I, ſaid the Princeſſe, when you have abſolutely made an end of your pennance, by finiſhing your ſtory, not yet performed, ſince the chiefe part is behind, the manner of my deliverance; which continued ſtill <hi>Narciſſus</hi> in his relation. After that the-<hi>Herauld,</hi> ſaid he, was returned without any ſatisfaction to my thoughts, in a melancholy jealouſie, I retired from the Army (it being the reaſon I was not in the laſt conflict, when the forces ſent from <hi>Soraſtros</hi> entred the Town) for that moſt deſperately I blamed your inconſtancy, ſince I believed you had conſented to <hi>Oſiris</hi> deſires. In this diſtracted poſture I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, untill I was ſent for by <hi>Orſames,</hi> to be made acquainted with your Dwarfs arrivall, who propounded to me the defigne that was to be executed. But the Gods know, my heart being freed from that deadly ſuſpition, of your being wonne by the greatneſſe of <hi>Oſiris</hi> perſon, I was ready in my own conceipt, to have reached a ſtarre from heaven, to have made you a preſent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall of the injury, my thoughts had done your vertue; ſo that I ſtayed not long to conſider of my reſolution; by which example many of the youthfull Nobility, out of emulation, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to take my part; however, the deſigne was not onely with a great deale of care, kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret from the knowledge of the common ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but it was ordained by the Councell of war, that the Army it ſelfe ſhould ſeem to retire from
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:98927:125"/>the ſiege, to give a greater cauſe of ſecurity to the Caſtle, whereby to be leſſe prepared; ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the more eaſily ſurprized upon the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the enterprize; with theſe reſolutions, (being fortified with couraglous hopes, ſince they carried with them the deliverie of your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſelfe, from a tyrannicall impriſonment, againſt all the laws of love and juſtice) we ſailed in ſmall barkes up the River of <hi>Nilus;</hi> and yeſterday by the conduction of your Dwarfe, we entred undiſcovered the Iron gate of the Ceſterne; where, after a little ſlaughter of the negligent watch, we became maſters of all the Courts of guard of the Caſtle; and ſo with eaſe enough paſt into the Hall, untill at laſt being diſcovered by ſome that fled from deſtruction, we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred by <hi>Oſiris,</hi> and the ſouldiers that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon his perſon; which gave us again new imployment, ſince in truth both he and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, defended themſelves with a courage to be commended; but in the end, our numbers, (I cannot ſay altogether our valours) made them all either our captives, or our ſacrifices. And ſo, ſweet Princeſſe, according to your command, you have the ſtorie of your own power, that is able to inſpire the weakeſt captives, with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force to become conquerours of the greateſt Monarchs.</p>
                  <p>But he was ſcarce come to this point, when he felt the ſmart of a concealed wound he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his thigh, which he perceived not whilſt he was hot with the fight; ſo that preſently he deſired leave to retire into his chamber, to have
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:98927:126"/>the aſſiſtance of the Chirurgions; which was granted him by <hi>Cloria,</hi> with a prettie feare how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of ſome danger, diſcovered by the often changing of colour in her face; yet when he was there and diſarmed, the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> quickly found that it was but a fleſh-wound, and therefore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to no hazzard, though ſome inconvenience; before he took his reſt, becauſe it began to be day, he commanded a Flag to be ſet upon the top of the Caſtle, to give warning to <hi>Orſames</hi> of the proſperous ſucceſſe of his enterprize; which gave occaſion to the King preſently, to march with his whole Army before the walls of the Town, which ſtruck the minds of the people, with ſuch a ſudden amazement, that upon a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that was ſent them to yield, they preſently called a Councell, to reſolve what anſwer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to ſo peremptorie a demand; having alſo notice that <hi>Oſiris</hi> was made a priſoner in his own Caſtle. This procured a great mutinie amongſt the inhabitants; for the Townſ-men having got the poſſeſſion of the walls, by reaſon of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers late ſallie, being willing to ſave their goods by any compoſition, reſolved to deliver <hi>Memphis</hi> to the enemies forces; whilſt the others, by way of honour, contended againſt the determination, not without ſome ſlaughter on both ſides; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, <hi>Orſames</hi> in the confuſion aſſaulting the City, with the aſſiſtance of thoſe ſouldiers in the Caſtle, who ſet upon their backs, quickly redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to ſo much reaſon, that the Town was willing to render upon compoſition, that <hi>Oſirus</hi> promiſing to pay ſuch a ranſome agreed upon;
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98927:126"/>ſhould have the freedome of his perſon, but <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſames</hi> would not yield, to have the glory of his Conqueſt ſpotted with any other condition, then what his owne mercy was willing to grant; And with theſe thoughts prepared his Army againe, to enter by force, vowing the deſtruction of all the Inhabitants. The Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of her Uncles reſolution, ſent a meſſenger to deſire him, that ſince ſhee had beene a Captive, ſo long a time to <hi>Oſiris</hi> power, that he would be pleaſed now, to make him perſonally a priſoner to her will, by which meanes ſhee ſhould in ſome ſort, revenge the indignity that was done to her birth and condition. This being granted, ſhee preſently ſent a diſcharge to <hi>Oſiris,</hi> to diſpoſe of himſelfe and ſouldiers, in what way he ſhould like for his moſt honour. The Prince, although he accepted of <hi>Cloria's</hi> noble courteſie, with all the expreſſions of thankfull acknowledgment could be deviſed, wherein he profeſt ſhee had more over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his thoughts, with her admirable humanity, then <hi>Orſames</hi> fortunes had his perſon with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing power; yet he aſſured her, he would pay that ranſome that was offered for his liberty; and withall ſent her a rich chaine of pearle, of an ineſtimable valew, which he beſought her, ſhee would weare on the day of her marriage for his ſake, as a remembrance of his deſire, to crowne her Queene not onely of his kingdomes, but of his heart. When the agreement was ſealed by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of both ſides, <hi>Orſames</hi> prepared to make his triumphant entry into the City, wherein <hi>Oſiris</hi> was intreated to be a party, but he not being
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98927:127"/>able, to brooke the ſight of a new Prince, to be inſtalled in his right, not onely excuſed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of ſuch a courteſie; but after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ceremonious viſit to the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> though carried in a chaire, becauſe his wounds would afford him no other commodity, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded himſelfe to be placed in his Litter, and ſo carried to the next Garriſon Towne under his jurisdiction, whilſt <hi>Orſames</hi> as a moſt glorious Conquerour tooke poſſeſſion of <hi>Memphis</hi> in this manner:</p>
                  <p>Firſt the Foote marched with Olive branches in their hands, that foretold peace and proſperity to the inhabitants, having all their armes adorned with Flower de Luces guilded, beſides the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their weapons, that by the reflection of the Sunne, gave a terrifying though pleaſing beauty to the Spectators. After theſe came the guard of <hi>Orſames</hi> perſon, being ten thouſand in number, who were ſo expert by reaſon of their continuall practice, that it was a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they more honoured their maſter in time of peace, or defended him in occaſions of Warre. When theſe were paſt, which ſhut up the firſt dayes Triumph, the next morning the Nobility richly apparrelled both in their owne perſons, and their horſes trappings, were ranked according to their degrees, who by the brave managing of their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious beaſts, gave admirable delight to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, ſince the Sun and the winde ſeemed both to conſpire in the ſhew, for as the one gave a glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering grace to the ſplendor of their habits, ſo the other gently playing with their feathers, rendred
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98927:127"/>them more becomming. Then the great Officers of <hi>Syria</hi> proceeded in Chariots, by reaſon of their ages and dignities, with all their Enſignes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour borne before them, to marke out to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the ſeverall qualities of their places, attended by multitudes of pages and footmen, diſtinguiſhed by their ſeverall liveries. After all theſe appeared <hi>Philoſtros</hi> himſelfe, the very ſoule of the Court, carried in an open Litter, ſince he was not to be ecclipſed from the eyes of the multitude, whoſe wiſedome and power was to give them Lawes: however he was ſurrounded by a particular guard of his owne, to prevent all dangers to his perſon; and although his clothing was ſimply red fatten, yet his attendants ſufficiently ſhewed forth his glory. But <hi>Orſames</hi> was ſeated in a Throne drawn with foure Elephantes, wherein <hi>Iupiter</hi> might have triumphed, after his Victory againſt the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Giants, the Statue of <hi>Mars</hi> the God of War, was placed at his back, crowning him with a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious lawrell, whilſt many Cupids ſeemed to ſupport the curtaines of his Chariot, where his guard hem'd him in from the crowd of the vulgar, though not from the ſight of the people, ſince he was ſo high mounted in his ſeate. After followed the maſter of his horſe, leading a ſpare one of the <hi>Arabian</hi> breed, covered with a Capariſon of wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet Velvet, imbroidered with Flower de Luces of gold, bearing in his top a Phenix plum, which ſhew being paſt, the Cavalry of <hi>Syria</hi> brought up the reare, who exceedeth no more for beauty and number, then for skill and valour: And in this order followed their great maſter, to the chiefe

The reines of the bridle, were made into the forme of two Dragons necks, that

                  <p>After the King, and the reſt of the company, were againe placed in their ſeates, the two gallant Champions performed their courſes, with ſuch an equall bravery, that as it procured an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary delight to the people, ſo it raiſed ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the opinion of the judges, to whom they ſhould grant the prize; onely the Prince of <hi>Arabia</hi> in his laſt courſe loſt one of his ſtirropes, which was the reaſon that the queſtion was ouce more brought before the King, as the ſupreame Judge of the ſport: however the Prince, becauſe he would overcome the ſtrange Knight with his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, though not with his lance, prevailed ſo farre with <hi>Orſames,</hi> that he might buy his friendſhip by the diſcovery of his perſon, unto whoſe honour he was willing to ſacrifice the victory, hoping to purchaſe thereby as he ſaid, a greater Jewell, which was his acquaintance. With that the green Knight preſently pulling off his head-piece, was knowne of every one to be young <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who

                  <p>The unexpected diſcovery of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> perſon after the Turnament, gave occaſion to all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with a kind of a Triumphall though confuſed Aclamation, to expreſſe their extraordinary Joy, in that none but he as they ſaid who had ſubdued <hi>Oſiris</hi> greatneſſe, deſerved the honour of thoſe martiall ſports: however the gallant youth, eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his deſires but halfe ſatisfied, untill he had alſo in ſome ſort, procured the approbation of the beautifull Princeſſe, ſince ſhee alone he recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſole period of his endeavours: Therefore when he had performed his humble reſpects to <hi>Orſames,</hi> according to the lawes of the Tilting, and the cuſtome of the Countrey; he preſently caſt himſelfe at the feet of his glorious Miſtreſſe, with theſe words in his mouth: As it may eaſily be perceived what a powerfull influence, your rare perfections have over all hearts, and actions of men, ſo no doubt the heavens in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſigne, to render you the admirable patteme of your ſex, ſince your luſtre not onely hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in me a new ability, but the very power of your name, doth induce my Noble adverſary, to attribute to my ſmall performance, thoſe victorie,

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:98927:132"/>ſeemed at the inſtant, ſtrucke with ſome killing diſeaſe) finding his principall hopes thus in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment blaſted, when he thought he had had his happineſſe in poſſeſſion, had not one word to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either of reproofe or perſwaſion, ſo that he could not chuſe, but extreamely blame ſuch a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid ſeverity; untill <hi>Cloria</hi> againe by a gentle ſmile, gave him (as he thought) ſome new encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though no otherwiſe, then like people brought upon the ſcaffold ready to dye, might receive from flattering enducements, to be repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, being onely framed by their owne indulgent fancies, without any other grounds; for alaſs alaſs, Tyrant honour, had ſo ſtrong a predomination in <hi>Cloria's</hi> diſpoſition, that death would ſooner have beene entertained in her wiſhes, then the leaſt decorum belonging to her baſhfull principles, could have been omitted in her reſolutions: In ſo much as all her faithfull lover <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was to expect for the preſent, was comfortable hopes of a future fruition: which ſoone conducted the whole company to the Caſtle, the place deſigned during <hi>Orſames</hi> ſtay, not onely for the glories of his Court, but for the recreation of all the other Princes, who ſpent the Time for the moſt part, in caſting what honours they could, upon the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lovers, whilſt in the interim <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> was imployed in receiving and entertaining Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, that from all places came to congratulate his Maſters victories.</p>
                  <p>But of the contrary <hi>Philos, Philoſtros</hi> Nephew, began by little and little, to engender dark clouds of diſcontent in his unquiet boſome, from whence
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98927:133"/>proceeded at laſt, thoughts of hatred and revenge, not onely in regard of thoſe ſparcles of love, which had flown from the bright rayes of <hi>Clorias</hi> beauty, but alſo, for that he found how all mens opinions, were tranſported beyond meaſure, to magnifie the gallant deſerts of brave <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> which (as he believed) did not a little overſhadow his own former ſucceſſes in the warres. Theſe diſtempers, I ſay, did not alone make him all day abſtaine from cheerfull company, but in the night time raiſed, for the moſt part, ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant fancies in his ambitious and working braine, that he remained in a manner continually tormented in his reſt; however, he endeavoured all he could, to keep the paſſions from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of vulgar eyes; or at leaſtwiſe, the cauſes of them: but as love and envy are two proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, too violent to be ſuppreſt in a heart infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with pride and proſperity, when as their effects can hardly be protracted, <hi>Philos</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, after he had in a ſort taken counſell of his haughty thoughts, and digeſted them in the generall, to comply with his reſolutions, to fall upon wicked and ignoble deſignes, ſeeing no way elſe could poſſibly bring about his purpoſes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own unruly appetites: And that was', violently to deſtroy the innocent and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous loves, between <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> which conveniency and opportunity was granted him, by reaſon there remained certain meſſengers in the City of <hi>Memphis,</hi> ſent from the Senate of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> among other troops of Ambaſſadours, imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to complement <hi>Orſames</hi> proſperity.</p>

                  <p>To this effect he made choyce of one of them, not being willing to communicate his ſecrets to more, untill he could finde a probable aſſurance, his project ſhould heartily be enterteined: as ſoone as this man repaired to his preſence, after ſome uſuall ſpeeches of kindneſſe and flattery, he conducted him by the hand, into a private Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net of his owne ſcarce viſited by any perſon whatſoever but himſelfe, being loath either to be diſcovered or interrupted; where, when he had made him ſit downe by him, with more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary familiarity, he uttered his mind unto him after this ſort.</p>
                  <p>Sir ſaid he, as you cannot but know by that proſperous progreſſe, which <hi>Evarchus</hi> your King, hath already made in his Warres, againſt the forces of your Senate at <hi>Sardis,</hi> that not onely the leaſt aſſiſtance, but any ſmall diſcountenance from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes, will utterly deſtroy your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, towards the compaſſing of your ends, in bringing him to a conformity with your inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though the world be yet ſcarce acquainted with what you deſire; ſo may you by evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations perceive, how farre hither unto, my Uncle <hi>Philoſtros</hi> hath complyed with your purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as well in rending <hi>Orſames</hi> indifferent to your proceedings, both againſt perſwaſion and his own inclination, as in ſeeming to countenance thoſe actions of yours, which not onely appeares de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to his Tenents, but in a manner is againſt the very honour of his family; for that <hi>Hyacinthia</hi> the Queen of <hi>Lydia,</hi> is as you very well know, a branch of the royall houſe of <hi>Syria:</hi> ſo that by

                  <p>It was ſomething long, before the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour returned him any anſwer at all, being as it were ſurprized betweene feare and doubt, what himſelfe ought to thinke, or what the other meant to doe; yet at laſt breaking through his ſeeming amazement, he delivered theſe words, with a humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity anſwerable to the neceſſity (as he thought) his Maſters had of his Uncles aſſiſtance, not onely to hinder any ſupplyes, to be ſent from the State of <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Evarchus,</hi> but to continue ſtill the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed commerce and Trade, between the two Nations, without which it was unpoſſible for the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia</hi> to ſubſiſt.</p>

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98927:135"/>Uncle, but ſince her arrivall at Court, ſhe not only became an ear-witneſs of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> comportment, but hath alſo been preſent at ſome of thoſe archive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, comportments of his, which for the preſent hath afforded him a competent opinion in the Army: whether his perſon or his ſame have moſt taken her fancy I will not ſay. But theſe inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions joyned with the former Treaty, have created ſuch an opinion in her thoughts, that ſhee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth her reputation to the world to be ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, if <hi>Narciſſus</hi> be ſuffered to offer his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to any other but her ſelfe, without her privity and conſent: In the interim nevertheleſſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that the Queene of <hi>Lydia</hi> arriving by chance upon the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> hath occaſioned <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to fall in love with the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> (whereby ſhe eſteems her ſelfe ſlighted: and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured not onely in regard of the former Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mentioned, but alſo in that any ſhould appeare in this horizon, more worthy of reſpect then the Neece of great <hi>Philoſtros</hi>) is growne deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in her reſolution: whether I may call her paſſions prepoſterous or no, I will not diſpute, onely I may probably believe, that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> loves to <hi>Cloria,</hi> are neither grounded upon right or reaſon, ſince as our Treaty if not engagement was begun upon more mature conſideration, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied perhaps with ſome promiſes of either ſide, ſo can it not ever be thought, that the declining condition of <hi>Evarchus,</hi> will at any time bring happineſſe to the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> much leſſe to the Duke thereof, when as all the benefit he ſhall receive from ſuch ambition, muſt be the exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98927:136"/>of his treaſure, and the endangering of his command: but however he and his ſon may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the conſequence of ſuch a conjunction to themſelves, yet no reaſon other Countreies, ſhould be debarred of their owne advantages, when they ſhall be offered meanes to proſecute their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: It is ſufficient we thinke it not convenient for your ſtate or our kingdome: which being, for the moſt part, allowed common people of never ſo inferiour a ranke, much more is it to be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Kings and Princes of the higheſt dignity: If reaſons of ſtate, ſhall breake and make marriages contracted by friends and kindred, what preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhall be denyed enemies to exerciſe one againſt another, when either danger or benefit appeares in the conſequence? the gods doe but unite hearts in Nuptiall Tyes, for the commodity of men, and certainly all generalls, are to be preferred before particular Intereſts, which being granted as a maxime, and the proofe demonſtrated of the good or evill, in my opinion we ought not to ſtumble at the execution, for as in my owne conſcience I am ſatisfied in the right of our pretenſions. So if you may make Warre with your King, becauſe he doth not ſatisfie the publick, without any queſtion you may alſo poſſeſſe your ſelves of all that is his, by the ſame Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe therefore be advertized: that as 'tis reſolved by the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Narciſſus</hi> violent proſecution) not to make election of him or any other for her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band without the full approbation of her Mother, ſo very probably may it be conceived, that the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98927:136"/>youth will be able, to pretend fairly to her love, being in his owne Countrey; when as he ſhall not onely have the commodity of ſollicitation, accompanied by the remembrance of all thoſe ſervices, he hath performed for her honour and ſafety, but alſo for that it may be thought by <hi>Hia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthia</hi> your Queene, that the marriage of her daughter with <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> may prove to be a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of extraordinary conſequence to her husbands buſineſſe, when by that meanes ſhee may thinke, to procure money in his Warres from the Dukes Coffers, being engaged to the ſame quarrell in the right of his ſonnes wife: beſides, it is to be ſuppoſed (or at leaſt-wiſe will be ſo imagined) by thoſe about the Queenes perſon, that the very intereſt of the Dukes power in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> (by reaſon of the numerous ſhipping in their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens) will upon all occaſions be able to ſupply <hi>Evarchus</hi> neceſſities, either with ammunition or ſouldiers, according to the need he ſhall have in his intention, againſt your Senate at <hi>Sardis:</hi> and who knowes not but <hi>Cyprus</hi> is a ſcit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Ambaſſador, when <hi>Philos</hi> began to take a
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98927:137"/>little breath replyed; that as it was the greateſt part of his own duty, to hearken to all deſignes, that might any way advantage his Maſters pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings at <hi>Sardis,</hi> ſo would he not faile in his owne particular, but to contribute the beſt of his endeavours, to render both him and his Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous family ſatisfied, hoping with all (as he ſaid) that the gods would largely aſſiſt to the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Lydia</hi> and the proſperity of <hi>Syria;</hi> by ſuch on indiſſolvable tye of friendſhip and commerce, that might make <hi>Orſames</hi> give lawes to the reſt of the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philos</hi> after he had made himſelfe more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from the earneſt proteſtation of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, went on with this diſcourſe in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
                  <p>Theſe two (ſaid he) pretended lovers, <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> (who rather may be eſteemed fools in prepoſterous affection, then true Politicians towards a well grounded and ſetled love, ſince as it may be thought, they neither feare prevention or provide againſt accidents) are now precipitate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haſting their journey into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where belike they hope to crowne their wiſhes, with an entire happineſſe in every kind can be deſired; however they give out, their ſuppoſed violence to be gone, proceeds from their paſſionate inclinations, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benedictions of their parents, after ſo long a time of abſence from their company and preſence: but whether it be ſo or no, (or rather their intentions are built upon their own private &amp; ſecret reſolutions one to another, which <hi>Cloria</hi> on her part is aſhamed publickly to diſcover) I
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98927:137"/>will not diſpute; Onely prevented they muſt be in their paſſage by Sea, and this cannot conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be put in execution any other way, then by your brave and invincible Navy, which will not onely abſolutely take off all opinion of jealouſie, in regard of your <hi>Senates</hi> difference with <hi>Evar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> but when you have by this meanes ſeparated the young Couple, and ſo by conſequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their loves, you may have the benefit and commodity, to diſpoſe of the Princeſſe perſon, to what match you ſhall thinke moſt probable for your advantages; whereas in doing otherwiſe (whether ſhee marry <hi>Narciſſus</hi> or no) it is likely to whomſoever ſhee ſhall be contracted, both their obligations and promiſes muſt be grounded upon conditions, to aſſiſt <hi>Evarchus</hi> in his Warres againſt your <hi>Senate;</hi> which perhaps may prove of too great a concernment and prejudiciall to your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires: in ſhort this is all I have to ſay unto you, untill I know more of your mind.</p>
                  <p>As the Ambaſſadour was very fearfull to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe <hi>Philos,</hi> conſidering the need the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Lydia</hi> had of his Uncles friendſhip, ſo of the other ſide he was moſt unwilling (if not partly reſolved) not to undertake of himſelfe, a buſineſſe of ſuch a dangerous conſequence, where the Iſland of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> might have any intereſt in the deſigne; ſo that after ſomething a long pawſe, as if he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed leave of his conſideration to make a reply, he returned him this anſwer:</p>
                  <p>My Lord, ſaid he, although I would not have you in any kinde thinke, I either fall from my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or goe from my profeſſions, yet I muſt

                     <hi>Philos</hi> by this reply, ſufficiently perceived the craft and cunning of the Ambaſſador; that was not to be engaged, with any diſadvantage for any party, notwithſtanding all his violent and glorious
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:98927:138"/>Profeſſions: beſides by his diſcourſe, he found (as he imagined) a great deale more affectionate deſire in his thoughts, to entertaine a firme cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondency with the Common wealth of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> then with the State of <hi>Syria;</hi> which upon any termes he was reſolved to hinder, as conceiving it extreamly prejudiciall to the intereſt of his own Nation: not onely in regard of the ſcituation of the Iſland, but alſo for that <hi>Cyprus</hi> formerly ever had, a moſt particular dependancy upon the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Syria,</hi> both for trade and protection: wherefore after a little time of ſilence, dreſſing his countenance with a certaine kinde of ſcornefull ſmile, as if not onely he contemned his doubts, but alſo diſvalued his reaſons; at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant taking him by the hand, and griping it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hard, as it were betweene kindneſſe and choller, he delivered himſelfe unto him in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Alaſſe poore men ſaid he, where are your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages and wiſedomes? Truly for my part, I doe not more wonder, how you durſt with ſuch low thoughts, undertake ſuch deſperate deſignes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Prince, then now when you have made ſuch a progreſſe in them (as I may ſay paſt any retreat) you ſeeme to ſtumble at ſmall reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: no my friend be you aſſured, there is not any obſtacle, can ſo ſoone obſtruct the full period of your deſignes, as the want of putting in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this project; for by that omiſſion, you doe not onely afford your enemy <hi>Evarchus</hi> breath and aſſiſtance, by the certaine ſupply he ſhall have from the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in regard of this marriage,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:98927:139"/>but you are aſſured to loſe a friend of our family, who can moſt hurt you in theſe parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> not finding you willing to pleaſure us, when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion is fairely offered into your hands: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that you may be converted, and made know that I perfectly perceive your errour, I ſhall in a few arguments, give ſome anſwer to your feares; for I ſee weake digeſtions, muſt have light meates for their appetites, not onely to keep them from ſurfeit, but ſquemiſhneſſe: I doe the more willingly ſtudy your ſatisfaction in this nature, that if it be poſſible, you may perſwade your maſters at <hi>Sardis</hi> to undertake this giant worke with leſſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: nevertheleſſe I muſt alſo tell you, what is to be done, muſt be done preſently, in regard the Princeſſe preſſeth her departure with all violence.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place therefore that you may ſend to your <hi>Senate,</hi> to acquaint them with the deſigne intended, is not onely fit but neceſſary, though withall I muſt warne you, that it ought not to be communicated, but to a few privately, leaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revealed you not onely thereby loſe the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the project, but ſhall alſo contract more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a ridiculous conſequence againſt your proceedings, having falſly undertaken (as your adverſaries will interpret) a buſineſſe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that you had not underſtanding ſufficient to proſecute to the end: This in like manner gives me intimation to advertiſe you, of onely two ſhips providing for the young peoples tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the one for <hi>Cloria,</hi> the other for <hi>Narciſſus:</hi> in the next place, whereas you pretend a feare, that the diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98927:141"/>opinion he ſeemed to have of his owne fidelity, to the ſervice of his family, when he durſt truſt him as he ſaid with a ſecret of ſuch a nature and conſequence, he vowed not onely, with as much induſtry and underſtanding as poſſibly he could, to make his Maſters acquainted with the deſigne, but alſo to be very ſenſible of the obligations due from the State of <hi>Lydia</hi> to himſelfe, whereby the <hi>Senate</hi> might be ready upon all occaſions, to be ſerviceable to his Illuſtrious and moſt Noble Family, in requitall of his many favours: when he had ended theſe complements (and probably they were not any otherwiſe to be eſteemed, ſince for the moſt part Miniſters of State, are not much troubled either with good nature or charity) he demanded of <hi>Philos,</hi> whether or no he ſhould make his fellow Commiſſioners privy to any of theſe paſſages; for that as he ſaid having equall authority with himſelfe, it might elſe be imputed to him as an act either of preſumption, or give cauſe of too great a ſuſpition, not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the intentions to ſuch Counſells, before it was to be moved to the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Lydia:</hi> for that ſaid <hi>Philos,</hi> if at any time theſe proceedings come to be laid to your charge as a crime, you may very well alledge my deſire was, by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the contrary, in regard there were ſo many ſpies remaining of other Nations at <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis,</hi> that ſcarce could it have beene hid from publick knowledge: neither would I have many of your unneceſſary Senators themſelves, made knowing of ſuch a ſecrecy between us, ſo cautious I am in that particular: but onely to be imparted

                  <p>When <hi>Philos</hi> had condeſcended to all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the Ambaſſador, having firſt as may be ſuppoſed rendred him ſully ſatisfied in very many particulars in State policy, which the meſſenger before had neither learned or underſtood, they tooke their leaves of one another, with ſuch an entire embracement, as if their bodies were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually to be joyned in nature, as their ſoules were combined in the deſtructive deſignes, to the poore lovers felicities: but now <hi>Philos</hi> being left alone, with a ſtrong confidence of the wiſhed ſucceſſe of his unhandſome project, he pleaſed himſelfe ſufficiently with the conſideration, how much he found the Ambaſſador inferiour to his skill, in politicall rules; for that by a contrary ſtratagem, it ſeemed to him eaſie, to deſtroy all the <hi>Lydian</hi> Fleet, if he did not conceive, that the effecting of this enterprize, would be much more
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98927:142"/>advantageable to his other affaires; and at the worſt he knew, it was in his power by diſcovering the deſigne, before it was acted, to create ſuch a jealouſie between the two common governments, as would alwaies make them at oddes one againſt another, to the commodity and benefit of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſames</hi> Kingdome; which could not any way be overpowered, but by the conjunction of thoſe two Nations at ſea, who onely aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in multitude of ſhipping; which how ever ſhee intended to put in practice, when hee had compaſſed his own ends upon them both: in the mean time he was content to let the <hi>Lydian</hi> Ambaſſador, not onely to play with his owne thoughts, but to become inſtrumentall for ſome ſeaſon to his purpoſes; that were upon the ſurprizall of the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> and the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her love, to demand <hi>Evarchus</hi> daughter of the <hi>Senate</hi> for his wife; not doubting but the ſuite would be eaſily granted, in regard of that friendſhip, they deſired to maintaine with his Uncle <hi>Philoſtros;</hi> And then alſo, to make the like motion to the Duke of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> concerning a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to be made between his Son <hi>Narciſſus</hi> and his owne ſiſter <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> which he conceived might be done without the leaſt ſuſpition he had any former hand in the deſigne; for he knew the Ambaſſadour durſt not reveale the ſecret pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, leſt it might be ſuſpected himſelfe to have combined or plotted the diſcurteſie, offered to the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus</hi> in the violence uſed at ſea to <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> And at the worſt he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he could deny at his pleaſure any ſuch thing

                  <p>
                     <hi>Philos</hi> now having eaſed (as I may ſay) the heavy weight of that burthen, which he found lay continually upon his confuſed thoughts and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king fancy, not onely by reaſon of his love to <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> but his hate to <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> began alſo to think, that diſſimulation from that time forward, would be a moſt neceſſary companion to all the reſt of his actions, ſince as already, he had betrayed the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers felicities in his owne determinations, ſo were they, with others of <hi>Orſames</hi> Court to be kept, as much as might be free from all ſuſpition and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, untill the grand project contrived between him and the Ambaſſador, (who undertooke to be the meſſenger himſelfe) might have a fitting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency to be put in execution, which he could not yet be certaine of, untill the returne of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſhould come from the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Lydia:</hi> in the interim he had warned the Ambaſſador, not to uſe his name to his Maſters in the particularity of the deſigne; but rather to ſeeme as if the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, had onely moved from his owne intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence being at <hi>Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98927:143"/>moſt delightfull company, both of the Towne and Court, and to this purpoſe, he would not onely often goe a hunting of <hi>Eſtriges,</hi> according to the frequent uſe of the Country, in the wild deſerts bordering upon the confines of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> attended by many of the ordinary ſorts of people, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the King himſelfe, to celebrate in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Theatre neere the <hi>Pyramides,</hi> the magnificent ſports of fighting with Lyons, and other ravenous beaſts of <hi>Aphrica;</hi> but chiefly with an intention, to entertaine the youthfull thoughts of <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> that they might not ſo violently thinke upon their intended journey into <hi>Gyprus:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all theſe projects contrived in his braine, one day when <hi>Orſames</hi> was a hunting, he addreſt himſelfe to <hi>Narciſſus</hi> particularly, intending a little to feele his inclinations, or rather I may ſay, to perſwade his judgement, contrary to the very maxims of his heart, where in a moſt familiar way he uſed this kind of diſcourſe unto him:</p>
                  <p>My Lord, ſaid he, it ſeemeth ſtrange unto me, how the glory of your youth and valour, can be confined, to any other region in the world then <hi>Syria?</hi> where not onely worth is beſt underſtood, but vertue from thence ſeemes to take her birth and originall; for in truth other Nations appeare but to practice by her imitation and example: Sciences there I muſt tell you, are taught new rules to walke by, whilſt admination ſtands at a maze, to behold more then could be thought were poſſible, for both art and nature to produce to mans capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to underſtand: if you looke at the Court, you may ſee, how riches and honour goe hand in

                  <p>But how this diſcourſe, or rather Dialogue would have beene concluded betweene them, can not well be determined, ſince a great <hi>Panther</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to thoſe deſerts, lying ſecretly in certaine ſhrubs by the ſide of a poole, not onely for the preſent interrupted them, but violently flew upon <hi>Philos,</hi> as he rid along with <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> which quickly overturned both him and his horſe, to the apparent danger and hazzard of his life, but that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> having a ſmall hunting ſpeare in his hand, quickly ſtroke the beaſt ſo fortunately in the breſt, that the blood ſoon followed the wound in great abundance; however the furious, or I
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98927:145"/>may ſay rather valiant creature, ſeemed ſo little to be diſcouraged by the ſtroake, that with an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing outward rage, to finde himſelfe ſo aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted contrary to his expectation, looking firſt upon <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> as if he either challenged him with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſſe or ingratitude, for having attempted him without any provocation, and then turned his eyes againe upon <hi>Philos,</hi> as if yet he made ſome queſtion in his thoughts, whether he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe his ſeeming conquered Captive, or be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon his injurer, at laſt flew at <hi>Narciſſus</hi> with ſuch a ſpight and violence, as not onely put him to his beſt defence, but undoubtedly had prevailed exceedingly to his prejudice, if <hi>Philos</hi> had not haſtily diſingaged himſelfe from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency of his fall, and made haſt to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: as fearing elſe his owne death might fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which ſoone obliged them all three to a moſt ſharp and deſperate combat: And however the <hi>Panther</hi> received multitudes of wounds by their induſtry, inſomuch as it was unpoſſible for him to eſcape deſtruction, yet with his clawes, ſeiſing by chance upon the left arme of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> he made in it ſo deep an impreſſion, that he tore part of the fleſh from the bone, ſhewing that he was even ambitious of revenge in his laſt end; for preſently in a ſtaggering manner (not having ſtrength ſufficient remaining, to ſupport any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his owne body, which one might perceive his courage was loath to confeſſe) he fell backward upon his taile, and ſo reſted for a great ſpace, pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and blowing with open mouth: but both <hi>Narciſſus</hi> and <hi>Philos,</hi> not being very willing to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98927:146"/>complement with his intentionall fury, gave him ſo many other ſtroaks in all parts, that not long it was before they left him for dead, in the interim many of the hantſmen comming into the place: but the beaſt, as if he yet retained ſome vigoar or malice in his heart, notwithſtanding for a long time there appeared no life at all in him, whilſt the company were diſcourſing ſeverally of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and incounter, and applying ſome reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ſtop the bleeding of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> wounded arme, the <hi>Panther</hi> of a ſudden, not onely againe revived, but flew violently upon one of the dogs lying neere him, and bit him ſo, that the bloud followed, which in a manner ſtartled the whole company thinking him to be dead: wherefore againe they ſet upon him, though with a jeſting violence, untill at laſt they made him ſure from doing any more hurt to them or any others:</p>
                  <p>However this unexpected wound, which <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> had received in his arme, from the ſharpe clawes of the <hi>Panther,</hi> was not eſteemed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelſe either dangerous or worth much conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet by way of conveniency if not neceſſity, both he and the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> were forced for ſome time longer, to put off their journey to the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which ſeemed much to comply with the contrived deſigne of <hi>Philos,</hi> for their ſurprizall at Sea by the <hi>Lydian</hi> fleet, ſince for ſome dayes <hi>Narciſſus</hi> not onely kept his chamber but his bed, which however afforded him many viſites, from all the youthfull. Nobility of the Court, as I may ſay in ſome ſort ſeemingly glad of the accident, whereby he might by reaſon of
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:98927:146"/>that neceſſity, be ſtill obliged to remaine in their company; This cure of his, protracted the time ſo long, that the ſeaſon of the yeare drew on, for the ceremonious cutting of the bankes of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Nilus,</hi> whereby the whole Country of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> might be fludded, to augment its fertility; or rather to take away the naturall barrenneſs of the ſoile, which would be occaſioned by ſuch omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: To this worke of induſtry belonged certaine triumphes, that had beene time out of minde inſtituted, by the ancient Kings that governed the people, which cuſtome, as the inhabitants (by a certaine kinde of ſuperſtition in their diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) every yeare moſt religiouſly obſerved, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in ſome ſort their wealth would increaſe with their devotion; ſo <hi>Orſames</hi> himſelfe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the better, to retaine the affections of his new conquered Subjects of that Nation, was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not onely to be preſent at thoſe ſports in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but <hi>Philos</hi> thinking it alſo a moſt opportune occaſion to demonſtrate his Uncles greatneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to entertaine that night, the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Princes at <hi>Memphis,</hi> in a moſt magnificent manner, though his chiefe intentions were to ſee, whether he could by that meanes, the ſooner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne the affections of <hi>Cloria,</hi> to whoſe honour he ſeemed to conſecrate his feaſt, whereby more particularly to beſtow the loves both of her ſelf &amp; <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> upon him and <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> by reaſon of a certaine kinde of luſtre, domineering as might be thought more in their family, then any others viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Aſia,</hi> in regard of <hi>Philoſtros</hi> intimacy and power with <hi>Orſames:</hi> theſe were his fantaſticall
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98927:147"/>thoughts, grounded onely upon opinion and his owne ambition, when as the vertuous loves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> were eſtabliſhed upon diamond rocks, not to be ſhaken by any blaſts of greatneſſe or fortune.</p>
                  <p>When the day came for this mighthy ceremony (the people being aſſembled upon the banks of the River) the whole afternone was ſpent, in the taking and deſtroying of <hi>Crocodiles,</hi> which with certaine baited hookes of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>At what time <hi>Philos,</hi> according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his invitation, conducted the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> to his lodgings, in full oppoſition to the other Caſtle, with the reſt of the Noble company then remaining at <hi>Memphis;</hi> and however <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi>
                     <pb n="283" facs="tcp:98927:147"/>felt ſome incommodation, in regard of the wound he had ſo lately received, without any great imporunity was perſwaded by <hi>Philos</hi> to be of the ſame ſociety; it being in ſome ſort alſo intended for his entertainment, that hee might not onely be an eye-witneſſe of the glory of <hi>Philoſtros</hi> family, but (as the ſequell will te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie) have a view of his intended Miſtreſſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temeſia Philos</hi> ſiſter, having never during his abode at <hi>Memphis</hi> beheld her perſon, though for what reaſon, was not known by any.</p>
                  <p>The room that was deſigned for the Feaſt was perfectly Ovall, crowned on the top with a brave <hi>Cupelo,</hi> according to the antick <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> manner, adorned almoſt all over, with ancient <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> in <hi>Moſaick</hi> worke: the Galleries of each ſide for the commodity of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, were wrought into ſeverall intricate knots of gilded braſſe, intermixt with other colours, for the more beauty of the eye: the table it ſelfe alſo anſwered exactly to the ovall proportion of the room, leaving a convenient ſpace from the wall, for the commodity of neceſſary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants: it was in the middle hollowed in a large meaſure, to take off a part of its bredth, the company onely being appointed to ſit, without any oppoſition to one another: however in that ſeeming vacancy of the board, was erected from the ground a moſt ſtately fountaine (that at leaſt reached halfe way to the upper part of the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) where appeared, the goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> and her Nymphs bathing themſelves, cut out in moſt excellent white Marble, which being alſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:98927:148"/>with certain artificiall Trees, according to the nature of the Countrey, it afforded a moſt delectable proſpect to the beholders; and the rather, for that the Fountaine being built, in a ſeeming criſtall lake of cleare running water, brought thither by the ancient Kings of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> with infinite charge and admirable skill, not onely proved exceedingly, to be a commodity to the Feaſt, but a refreſhment to the company; eſpecially for that from their ſeeming naked breaſts, there continually runne, into ſeverall ſmall veſſels appointed for that purpoſe, all ſorts of excellent Wine, both Greek and Aphrican, where daintie boyes ſtood ready to diſpoſe of it to the ſtrangers, when any pleaſed to call for it, of each ſort: the company at the firſt entrance into the roome, ſeemed to be a little amazed at ſuch a magnificent beauty, which they knew not of to be before in <hi>Memphis;</hi> though the building had not onely long time agoe, been erected by the greateſt Monarchs of thoſe parts: but the place it ſelfe had for many yeeres paſt, been reſerved ſuperſtitiouſly by the inhabitants, for no other uſe, but for the celebration of the day and night, when the banks of <hi>Nilus</hi> were to be opened, to let in the water over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. Thus they continued caſting their eyes about at ſeverall varieties (the Muſick in the interim, meeting with the concavity of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, to the beſt advantage to the care) whilſt of a ſudden, there flew open a two-leaved doore, that directed its proſpect, through a large and long Gallery into another room, at the upper end
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98927:148"/>of which appeared a Lady ſitting on a Throne'; however at ſuch a diſtance that her countenance could not be perfectly diſtinguiſhed: but being ſoon conducted by <hi>Philos</hi> towards the place, ſhe was quickly diſcovered by his information, to be his ſiſter the moſt faire <hi>Artemeſia;</hi> at leaſtwiſe ſo eſteemed in her own opinion: and truly was ſo in effect, if her minde had in every kinde been anſwerable to her body, ſince any way wanting the inward beauty, ſome defect of neceſſity muſt be in the whole; and ſo conſequently not moſt faire: Upon their approach, they found her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed by many Negro ſlaves, who with huge Fanns in their hands, appeared to give her breath and refreſhment: but why onely ſo accompanied, could not well be imagined, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it were by the blackneſſe of her attendants, the better to ſet forth her own beauty in the apprehenſion of the ſpectators: when they came at ſomething a neerer diſtance (for before ſhe would not ſeem to riſe) in a certain kind of careleſſe poſture, ſhe deſcended from her Throne, whilſt the lovely Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> (with another kind of quickneſſe in her carriage, made up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween courteſie and good nature, wherein pride had not the leaſt intereſt) addreſt her ſelfe to give her an affable and fitting ſalutation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding not onely from the gentleneſſe of her diſpoſition, but the gratitude in her thoughts, in that her brothers entertainment, was wholly upon the matter (as was pretended) intended for her welcome and reception. Nevertheleſſe <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſia</hi> met her with ſuch a countenance, as if ſhe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:98927:149"/>yet made some queſtion, which of both was to be eſteemed the perſon of moſt dignity; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever at laſt <hi>Artemeſia</hi> gave <hi>Cloria</hi> the better hand, though with that demeanour, that did more divulge her inſolency, then ſhew her judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the aſſembly: but ſelf-opinion, when onely governed by an imperious ſoule, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with paſſion and proſperity, can have no other cure, but either by deſtruction in effect, or contrary fortunes in poſſeſſion: but all this, as it ſhould ſeem, was to gaine a heart from poore <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> that was aready captivated by a ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger influence; who, though he had underſtood her meaning, hee could not have been brought from ſacrificing to vertue and goodneſſe, to have committed idolatry before a painted image; wherein was contained, as might be thought, nothing but pride and vanity. To be ſhort, theſe ridiculous paſſages in a ceremonious march, conducted them to take their places. The feaſt it ſelfe did not exceed more in ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous magnificence, then in exquiſite curioſity: for the fruits ſeemed rather all growing upon naturall Trees, ther conveyed to their taſte by induſtry; whilſt birds of all ſorts in the interim flew about the room, warbling forth ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of notes, to entertain the company, as if they had been taught their skill by excellent maſters. And the more admirable it was, in regard the clarity of the place, by reaſon of an artificiall ſplendour newly created, proceeding from divers places in the room, rendred their ſeverall colours to the view, more beautifull
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:98927:149"/>then they were by nature ordained. It were a kind of groſſe ſimplicity to talk of abundance, when as the power of <hi>Syria,</hi> joyned with the fertility of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> conjoyned with a full, if not (as I may ſay) an omnipotent ability, to perſwade love, and ſhew greatneſſe.</p>
                  <p>But however this entertainment ſeemed to be the proviſion of many ages, and the feaſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſome yeeres continuance, yet that nights ceremony (though cuſtomary in it ſelfe, yet at the preſent, ordained for the ſight of the greateſt eſteemed Monarch in <hi>Aſia</hi>) could not waite upon any other intention or conveniency; wherefore, the company being advertiſed that <hi>Orſames</hi> with his Favourite in the other Caſtle, were already ſeated, expecting the ſhew, in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing a confuſed manner riſe from the Table, leaving all other ſervices behind to be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended onely to fancy and imagination; ſince every one haſted to thoſe windowes upon the River, that were moſt, convenient for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: for that already the fire flying in the ayre, and the Trumpets ſounding upon the land, appeared to ſenſe, as if the heavens had changed, their ſtations: for as the night ſeemed to be day, by a contrary, though a more illuſtrious reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo mortalls might be thought to have aſſumed to themſelves the property of gods, in regard of the reſplendent glory of the King, who ſat upon the top of the great Caſtle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed about with ſuch multitudes of lights, and that variety of attendants, that he ſeemed not onely to be the conquerour of the earth, by
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98927:150"/>a juſt right, but even to claime an appearing and divine intereſt, of ſomething miraculous during his time here below. In fine, nothing could be ſeen more ſplendent for the time; which drew all the eyes of the people upon his glory with ſuch an amazed joy, that ſearce could they with hearts and cries, abſtaine from open Idolatry: but notwithſtanding all theſe inticements of ſenſe, <hi>Artemeſia</hi> (however more bewitched in her paſſions then any other) could not be perſwaded, neither by her brother, or the reſt of the company, to be at all a ſpectator of thoſe ſports: but whether out of a vaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that ſhe ſeemed in her thoughts to contemne every popular ſpectacle, as being a great deale below her aymes and deſignes? or whether ſhe could not brook the competition of <hi>Cloria's</hi> beauty and dignity? or indeed was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Melancholy</hi> as <hi>Philos</hi> had informed the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador, it is not to any great purpoſe to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: onely it was viſible that in a kind of a disdainfull poſture, ſhee without any manner of ſalutation to the company, retired ſuddainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her chamber.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all theſe paſſages, <hi>Philos,</hi> whoſe heart and thoughts, were already too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſet upon his owne particular concerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (however he found more cauſe of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire every day then other, of parting the young lovers affection, although he might by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of his deſignes ſever their perſons, and had made his ſiſters prepoſterous paſſions, in part, as a ſtale, the better to compaſſe his owne ends)
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98927:150"/>though he would have been moſt willing alſo, to have rendred her entirely ſatisfied, in regard the contrary (as he thought) ſomething condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the diſhonour of the family, began a little to conſider what he ſhould doe at the preſent: wherefore becauſe he would leave no way unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, that might pretend to probability, and finding the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> at a window alone, earneſtly beholding the fire-workes and other paſtims, anſwerable to the ſeaſon, which ſeemed ſomething convenient for his purpoſe, he began a diſcourſe to her in this nature, as he had formerly done a hunting to <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> although the noyſe of the people below upon the bankes of the river, ſeemed not very well to comply with his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
                  <p>Madam ſaid he; you may here behold in part, the infinite glory and happineſſe of the King your great Uncle in his owne proper Spheare, the rich City of <hi>Damaſcus:</hi> but preſently finding ſhee could not perfectly underſtand what he ſaid, by reaſon of the cryes and ſhouts of the multitude, thongh he perceived an inclination in her courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, to harken to the matter of his diſcourſe, as well as the ſound of his word, drew her by little and little from the window, untill they were both retired to ſuch a diſtance, that they had free liberty, to underſtand what each other would deliver, which made him begin againe in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Truly ſaid he, ſince theſe magnificencies now beheld, are no better then meere ſhadowes, to what brightneſſes <hi>Orſames</hi> enjoyes in his owne
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98927:151"/>Countrey (of which you have already a large ſhare by birth, being ſprang from that flouriſhing tree, of that Illuſtrious and Royall houſe of <hi>Syria,</hi> and ought to have more in my opinion by poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in regard of thoſe rare perfections, which both art and nature have ſo liberally beſtowed upon your ſelfe, to the wound of your Sexe) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but ſomething amazed, if not ſcandalized how your thoughts, can carry you into any othrr region, (eſpecially having ſuch conveniencies) before you had taſted of thoſe excellencies in <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> that may not againe be ſo well underſtood and apprehended, as by ſuch curious fancies as yours, that are able even to adde a new life both to them, and to every thing elſe you ſee and heare: I muſt tell you moſt admirable Princeſſe, that the Nobility of <hi>Syria</hi> in their owne proper Elements, appeare rather like ſo many ſoveraigne Lords themſelves, crowned with honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, then Subjects to any mortall King whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, by reaſon of their commands and dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, not any way to be equalled, or made leſſe by what power ſoever, (continuing in <hi>Orſames</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) but as their owne retirements, ſometimes give them appetites for private recreations, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become familiar and ſolitary; Alaſſe dear Madam ſaid he, did you but behold the glorious Pallaces of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with other rich buildings of leſſer note, (onely appointed to be the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Merchants) you would thinke this great eſteemed City (ſo much extoll'd by the boaſting <hi>Aegyptians</hi>) to be but an unfurniſhed village, in regard of its magnificence and ſplendor; and for

<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98927:156"/>ſuitors, but according to the diſſembling cuſtome of that policy, which properly belonges to the actions of States-men, he ſalluted every perſon he met, with ſeverall voluble complements, that were of force ſufficient to have made them believe they had abſolutely his heart in all their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if experience had not taught them often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the validity of favourits words: however they were to comply in countenances, as he did in language: which continued all things in a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming calme in the Court of <hi>Orſames,</hi> untill the two young lovers <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> could be no longer perſwaded to ſtay, by the alluring en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements, magnificences, and pleaſure of the ſame: wherefore, as a couple of gallant ſhips were provided for their tranſportation, (ſince for the honour of <hi>Syria</hi> it was not held convenient, one veſſell ſhould containe both their perſons, though the lovers themſelves were not well pleaſed with the ceremony) ſo <hi>Orſames</hi> himſelfe, would needs accompany them from <hi>Memphis</hi> to the ſea ſide: In the way they were met by divers petty Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, from thoſe Townes as they paſt downe the River of <hi>Nilus;</hi> which however protracted the time, longer then <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Narciſſus</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; not onely in regard of their owne paſſionate deſires to be in the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where they might have the opportunity, to proſecute the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of their wiſhes, according to their dictates of love and engagements; but for that they both knew alſo their affectionate parents, waited for their arrivall with a moſt violent zeale, having beene a long time before hand, by themſelves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertized of their comming.</p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:98927:156"/>
                  <p>So that after ſomething a long &amp; tedious journy, (becauſe they ſo eſteemed it) they arrived at the laſt Haven in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> where the faire and gallant proſpect upon the ſea, gave their eyes no bounds, but what the maine Ocean was content to afford them; which proved delightfull enough, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they had been ſo long a time ſhut up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween other varieties.</p>
                  <p>As this gave ſome period to their wiſhes, of imbarking ſuddenly for the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> ſo the chiefe Nobility of the Court appeared diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at the reſolution: for if the men ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and took a ſingular contentment in <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> Noble vertues, his gallant preſence being accompanied with youth and valour, ſo had the Ladies of <hi>Memphis</hi> no ſmall delight and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, in <hi>Clorias</hi> affable converſation; who had accompanied her in her journey; ſince ſhe had not ſo much pride in her diſpoſition, as to be either humorous or neglectfull, although ſhe never wanted a ſufficient Majeſty in her carriage, to make her ſelfe reverenced of all, according to the dignity of her perſon: to ſay the plaine truth, ſhe had a familiarity that perſwaded love from the meaneſt, however ſhe never failed to procure reſpect from the higheſt. And however, many croſſes had rendred her thoughts inwardly ſomething muſing, nevertheleſſe the greameſſe of her diſcretion, alwaies ſo tempered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall properties of it, that thoſe inclinations of melancholy, were never viſible, but to her governeſſe <hi>Roxana,</hi> in her own private Cabinet, when they entred ſeriouſly into confideration of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98927:157"/>their fortunes, which a certain kind of neceſſity ſometimes ſeemed to exact from them both: if at all ſhe appeared a little amazed at her frequent diſaſters, it was rather a mark of her extream innocency, then any courage ſhe wanted to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine her loſſes; as it were in a manner not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that it was poſſible for people to be ſo wicked, and the gods ſtill to continue entirely patient. Theſe are the attributes, (if not much more) that all indifferent tongues and pens muſt give her. And the <hi>Syrians</hi> in the generall, were loath to ſend away out of their own poſſeſſion, ſuch perfections into another Countrey, which they eſteemed farre leſſe worthy then their own; or rather, that ſhe accompanied with thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, ſhould be loſt from their ſociety and expectation; which I muſt confeſſe, made her faire perſon aptly to be likened to a rich ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meled caſe, all ſet over with Diamonds, and other precious ſtones; that notwithſtanding within, contained a picture that was not to be valued by any eſtimation: onely ſome ſympathy remained by a divine determination between the two lovers; for as ſhe was pleaſed by her very election, to paralel with her ſelfe <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> ſo he could love no other ever, but excellent <hi>Cloria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this poſture, I ſay, when they came to the ſea ſide, (in the interim the King leading <hi>Cloria</hi> by the hand) the ſweet Princeſſe, with a few beautifull teares in her faire eyes (being, as it were, loath to depart, though ſhe deſired no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then to be gone) fell down preſently
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98927:157"/>upon her knees, with a certain gentle intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of griefe, made up between ſorrow and baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: which however it for ſome ſpace hindred her expreſſions, yet at laſt ſhe took her leave of her great Uncle, in theſe words; May all the gods ſend you Sir, ſaid ſhe, both victory in warre, and proſperity in peace, untill the very world grow old with your fame: but the King quickly ſtopt her imprecations, by two or three loving kiſſes, imprinted upon her faire lips; which kept in the other part of her diſcourſe.

                  <p>Whilſt the company imployed their thoughts with theſe entertainments, the Marriners began to feare a change of the weather; as well for that many Dolphins appeared oftentimes to ſhew themſelves above the waves (an indubitable ſigne eſteemed of a ſtorm) as alſo for that the wind of a ſadden had altered its ſtation a great deale more Eaſtward, which as they perceived, diverted their courſe from the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and carried them directly towards <hi>Crete:</hi> the other ſhip in the interim, where <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was, ſeemed to be at ſome diſtance, having got the ſtart of them, by reaſon of thoſe ſports the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners had preſented to the Princeſſe.</p>

                  <p>The ſtorm increaſing, <hi>Cloria</hi> within a ſhort time, not being able longer to brooke the toſſing and rolling of the ſeas, caſt her ſelfe down upon her bed, to take off, as ſhe imagined, the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and incommodities of her indiſpoſition; in which poſture notwithſtanding, her fancy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as well diſturbed as her body, ſince both the cracks of thunder, with the uncouth whiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the windes in the night ſeaſon, became a great deale more unpleaſant to her apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. However ſhe was tied to thoſe obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, untill it ſhould pleaſe the gods, either to calme the ſeas, or put them in more ſecurity; But it ſhould ſeem neither her prayers, nor her companies wiſhes, were able at all to prevaile with the divine powers, ſo farre as to make them in opinion confident of their own ſafeties. Untill at laſt it was neceſſary, not onely to take down all the chiefe Tacklings belonging to the ſhip, but alſo the main Maſt it ſelfe: deſiring they might rather, commit their fortunes and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to the mercy of the ſeas, then any more rely upon the windes curteſie and gentleneſſe, ſince they could not caſt in their Ankors to any effect, by reaſon the water was ſo deep, and their Cables (as they knew) not ſtrong enough, to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaine the force of the tempeſt; which ſeemed rather to increaſe in violence, then to give them hopes of abatement.</p>

                  <p>It was about noon the next day before the windes abated, when the Marriners informed the Maſter, they ſpied ſome land at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the skie having ſuddenly cleared much

                  <p>As this gave them all ſufficient cauſe of joy and encouragement, ſo did they preſently let out the long-boat, that they had drawn in to the ſhip during the ſtorm, with intention to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of thoſe people, not onely neere what coaſt they remained, but how they might by their directions, provide in the beſt manner they could, for their conveniency of landing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to repaire their veſſell.</p>
                  <p>It was not halfe an houres time, before the boat again returned with this information, that as the land they were neere was part of the Iſland of <hi>Creet,</hi> ſo not above halfe a daies ſaile from that place, was the faire haven town of <hi>Pergame,</hi> whoſe governour at preſent, was a great Noble man of the Countrey named <hi>Dedalus,</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Iſland was divided into many factions, by reaſon of the differences between <hi>Euarchus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia</hi> and his Senate, had kept that City wholy for the Kings intereſt: this newes you may be ſure, had put the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> in ſuch an extaſie of joy, as would have created an entire felicity in her thoughts, if ſhe had not in the interim, called again to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, her ſeparation from <hi>Narciſſus:</hi> but the company, rather flattering her opinion, then aſſuring their own thoughts, that undoubtedly he was paſt all hazzard, being in ſo good a ſhip, ſhe was quickly perſwaded to goe to <hi>Pergame,</hi>
                     <pb n="308" facs="tcp:98927:160"/>reſolving there to remaine, not onely whilſt ſhe heard ſome newes of <hi>Narciſſus;</hi> but during a neceſſary conveniency might alſo be had, for the repairing of her own ſhip, being as they told her abſolutely uncapable (before ſhe was men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) to make any other voyage whatſoever: ſhe condeſcending to this counſell and advice, ſome of the fiſhermen were quickly hired with ſtore of money, to be their guides and conducters to <hi>Pergame:</hi> ſo that preſently tying a ſtrong Cable to the great veſſell, and ſetting many Rowers in one of the biggeſt ſhallops belonging to the Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen, they haled her along the ſeas towards the Haven, as it were in a kind of pleaſant Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; which they might the more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly doe, for that now the wind being in a manner wholly allayed, they ſeemed to enjoy upon the water a ſufficient calm for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>But notwithſtanding this commodity, it was almoſt the whole day, before they could draw their ſhip, neere a point of land that bordered upon the haven; ſo that <hi>Cloria</hi> was forced for one night, to take up her lodging in a poore cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: however, this gave her thoughts more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction then the ſtately veſſell belonging to the kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> had her body in the ſtorme. When the day came, as it was determined, to continue their reſolutions for the City of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game,</hi> ſo was it held convenient before the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe approach, to give notice to the Governour, of her accidentall arrivall, within the dominion of his juriſdiction.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:98927:160"/>execution, by ſending a meſſenger before; whilſt they themſelves within two houres ſpace, were ſet a ſhore upon a promontory not many furlongs from the Town.

You may be ſure <hi>Cloria</hi> was not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to give him thanks, aſſuring him of her kind acknowledgement of his endeavours. This conducted her to her company quickly (for the time was not proper for much complements) to take poſſeſſion of a brave, though ancient Caſtle, ſeated upon a little riſing at the further end of the Town, whilſt the inhabitants in the interim, being placed in order of each ſide the ſtreets, gave the Princeſſe a joyfull welcome into that City, which her father (as they ſaid) had never viſited: ſo being at laſt brought into her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, with other ceremonies, it was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe went to bed, as well to reſt her mind, as her body; however ſhe firſt deſired the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to ſend out ſome ſmall ſhip of his own, then lying ready furniſhed in the Haven, to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out ſome tydings, concerning the other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however thus (by the goodneſſe of the
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98927:161"/>gods, the ſweet Princeſs had in a manner mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly eſcaped the danger of the ſeas, that ſeemed in ſome ſort even ambitious of her ruine, coveting perhaps to have entombed ſo dainty a body within their uncouth intrals; yet could ſhe not ſo ſoon ſhake off the malevolent effects of thoſe diſtempers, that had diſcompoſed her du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the tempeſt; which however they put her not in any danger of life, yet they did not onely keep her from being viſited by any whatſoever, but for the moſt part continued her in her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateſt chamber for a long time, where onely <hi>Roxana</hi> and ſome few ſervants more attended upon her perſon.</p>
                  <p>This gave the opportunity one day to <hi>Roxana</hi> (her Lady being aſleepe) to enquire of <hi>Dedalus,</hi> concerning the affaires of the Iſland; ſince, as ſhee ſaid, there could not chuſe but be many things worth the knowing, in regard of <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> contention with the Senate, belonging to the juriſdiction thereof.</p>
                  <p>Truely Madam, ſaid he, as the paſſages have been lately many and ſtrange, in this moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Iſland of <hi>Creete,</hi> ſo to give you the better ſcantling of the buſineſſes, that from time to time have hapned, I muſt in ſome ſort begin with the originall, when the Countrey firſt became under the <hi>Lydian</hi> power and juriſdiction. And to this purpoſe therefore you muſt know, that after the generation of the gods had totally left <hi>Creete,</hi> to a certain kind of wild barbariſme, not onely in the manners of the people, but in the rudeneſſe of the ſoyle, for want of being induſtriouſly
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:98927:161"/>manured, ſome of the ancient Kings of <hi>Lydia</hi> conceiving, that the Iſland lay convenient for the juriſdiction of their own Crown, both by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the naturall fertility of the ground, as in regard of the ſafety of the Harbours, began to create ſome ambition in their thoughts to be Lords of it; yet knowing, they could have no Title to the Countrey in their own right, but what the lawes of the ſword might violently (if not injuriouſly) afford them, made earneſt ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation, to the great <hi>Arch-Flammin</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> that in reſpect of the degenerating of the people, from all religious maxims, with the practice of other inhumane cuſtomes, (pretended to fall upon it for want of order and government) he would be pleaſed, under the ſacred banner of his holy protection and power, to grant them the principality and juriſdiction of the Iſland; upon the condition nevertheleſſe, that they ſhould ſtill be obliged, to obſerve thoſe rights in their ſacrifices to the gods, as were onely uſed in the Temple of <hi>Delphos:</hi> with theſe Titles and pretences, many of thoſe Princes, taking alwaies advantage of the inhabitants factions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement amongſt themſelves, ſent ſeverall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies either by force or policy, or both, to conquer the Countrey: which, to be ſhort, within ſome few yeeres was totally effected, notwithſtanding now and then many contradictions, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances hapned, proceeding rather from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant natures of the people, then that they had any great cauſe, to complaine of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Lydian</hi> Lawes and government.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98927:162"/>This gives me occaſion a little to digreſſe from the matter of the ſtory, with ſome explanation of the diſpoſition of the ancient Natives; which in part perhaps hath cauſed ſo many changes, and revolutions in our Iſland. Tis true, they have bodies capable of ſuch labour and activity, as might enrich the Countrey, if their mindes were anſwerable to their compoſure and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; but they are ſo extreamly lazy and proud by nature, that as they had rather beg or ſteale, then worke, or take paines; ſo doth the ſoyle wholly upon the matter lie unmanured; rather chaſing in forraigne parts any ſervile office what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, then they will make the beſt of their own livings, and eſtates, at home in their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: whilſt their wives and families alſo in the interim, are content to ſeek out new and ſtrange fortunes, with whole troops of attendants; not omitting nevertheleſſe the leaſt part of thoſe ceremonies, that belong to perſons of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt quality, although every night they lye in barnes, and in the day feed ſcarce upon any thing, that can afford nouriſhment to their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites. The women may be ſaid to be rather chaſte by nature, then that they can give any reaſon in their own thoughts, why they are honeſt at all; for that commonly they ſleepe altogether, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any diſtaſte in the general, or the leaſt ſhew of jealouſie in the particular; a laudable property, incident to moſt barbarous Nations, however perhaps meerly proceeding, from want of luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enticements, that uſe to enflame luſts in diſpoſitions. The men are valiant enough in
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98927:162"/>the warres of other countries; but whether by conſtraint or nature I will not ſay, ſince at home it is moſt apparent, they even want courages to defend their wives and children, rather truſting to their own craft and ſubtilty in circumventing their enemies, then any way deſiring with their ſwords in their hands to oppoſe; perhaps think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it a folly, where they any way can get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to complement about honour; for no people in the world hate with a more unrelent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpight, or revenge by a more hidden cruelty. When they goe to the wars, whole Troops and families follow, to accompany their friends, out of kindneſſe; though their intentions for the moſt part are thereby, to pillage camps of either ſide, according to the fortune of the day. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their religion, though they doe exactly adhere to the ancient rules of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and that with a ſeeming zeale outwardly, yet ſeldome or never perform they thoſe rights, with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obſerve any morality; in ſo much as it may be ſaid, they rather uſe ſuch cermonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they will not change cuſtomes, then that they hope to receive abſolute benefit by them; in this manner being content to ſuffer themſelves to be flattered, onely with an opinion they doe well, when they will not take any care at all to be better ſatisfied. In concluſion, they love to talke of lands and poſſeſſions, withheld injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly from their right, but never attempt any means probable to come to them againe. And this, Lady, being as neer as I can gueſſe, the trueſt character of our common people, I ſhall againe
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:98927:163"/>returne to the proſecution of our ſtory.</p>
                  <p>As I ſaid before, after the Kings of <hi>Lydia</hi> by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny defeats given to ſome of the principall of the Nobility, that eſteemed themſelves Princes in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and command, if not in Titles and right, had ſetled an abſolute <hi>Monarchy</hi> in the Iſland, by degrees, the people were brought into a kind of ſlaviſh condition, ſince they conceived, they were fitter to be made obey then to command, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of their lack of knowledge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in the generall, but alſo for that the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours perceived, that however they wanted ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient induſtry to mannage the Councells, as well as their lawes in their own Countrey, yet they had ſpight enough againſt the juriſdiction of ſtrangers: It was ſufficient they did not affect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, and therefore could not love the <hi>Lydians,</hi> inſomuch as notwithſtanding the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent benefit they found, by practiſing and uſing the <hi>Lydian</hi> cuſtomes, in many things concerning the ſowing of Corne and the like, they rather choſe to undergoe the penalty, for their not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in execution, then they would in any kind ſubject themſelves, to thoſe laudable and profitable obſervations; as if their pride appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſufficiently ſatisfied, in not ſeeming willing to follow that which certainly was the beſt, for no reaſon but that it was preſcribed them; however I muſt ſay the Noble men in the generall, were not onely for the moſt part very much civillized, but extreamely affected to the Crowne of <hi>Lydia,</hi> as knowing from thence were brought learning, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and education: though ſome great perſons
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98927:163"/>amongſt them, notwithſtanding rather endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to head many barbarous factions, (out of I cannot tell what manner of ſordid ambition) then they would either come to Court them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſeeme to hold, any friendly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency with any of thoſe that did, though they were of the ſame bloud and kindred with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which not onely raiſed many jealouſies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Nobility in the particular, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes cauſed a great Court ſuſpition, concerning the affections of the Nation in the generall, ſo that thoſe that for the moſt part, attended upon the perſon of the Kings in <hi>Lydia,</hi> notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their continuall induſtry, to doe their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſervice, were looked upon with no eyes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and grace, by reaſon of this unpoliſhed am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of thoſe Lords, that ſtill addicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the old Cretan manners; as it were lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it for no other cauſe, but that it ſeemed to thwart and contradict the <hi>Lydian</hi> cuſtomes: This pride indiſcreetly executed, at the firſt I ſay, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted jealouſies in our Princes, which againe retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hatred to us; wherefore, as the wiſedome of councellours, thinking to provide againſt rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would never make choiſe of any of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for governours, ſo the natives thinking themſelves diſhonoured thereby, were unwilling to obey ſuch Commanders ſet over them: upon this followed complaints on all ſides; And many of our Lords, not dring to diſpute the right of their juſtifications in <hi>Lydia,</hi> oftentimes forbore to appeare upon ſummons, ſo that advantages being made of their feare, rather then knowledge of
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98927:164"/>their crimes, their eſtates became confiſcated for their omiſſion, which of neceſſity enflamed their hearts to thoughts of more diſloyalty, untill at laſt their ſpleen (joyning with the humours of the people, who had not much to loſe becauſe they would poſſeſſe but little) made them at laſt fall into an open Rebellion, which for ſome yeares fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our Country with bloud and ſlaughters.</p>
                  <p>But now Madam ſaid be, as I have but hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto preſented you with a glaſſe, whereby you may the better underſtand the ſtory I am to tell, ſo ſhall I in as briefe a way as I can, repeate unto you not onely the occaſions as I conceive of the late Tragedies, acted in this poore and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſland, but alſo make you acquainted with the very realities themſelves: to this purpoſe I muſt ſay in the raigne of a late Queene of <hi>Syria,</hi> a woman endowed with admirable gifts of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as alſo had a ſpirit anſwerable thereunto, (whereby ſhee ſeemed to give her undertaking countenance) fell out both with the Arch <hi>Flamin</hi> of <hi>Delphos</hi> and the great King of <hi>Egypt</hi> at the ſame time: the firſt ſhee pretended uſurped an unjuſt Authority, over her Subjects and dominion, as the other ſhee alledged, too ambitiouſly endeavoured an univerſall Monarchy over all Princes: theſe differences likely to goe into ſome deſperation, betweene theſe mighty perſons and the Queene, gave cauſes ſufficient of admiration to all theſe parts of <hi>Aſia;</hi> and the rather for that, as they could not well comprehend, how ſuch a maſculine cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage could be in a woman, ſo did they as little know, in what manner ſhee would defend theſe
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98927:164"/>extraordinary breaches: but experience quickly made them ſee, ſhee not onely intended, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted her intentions with all vigour: for as ſhee abſolutely aboliſhed within a ſhort ſpace, all the juriſdiction of <hi>Delphos</hi> out of her Kingdoms, ſo did ſhe within a while after, give the King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> ſuch overthrows by ſea, that ſcarce could he in many yeers recover his loſſes. In the interim, whilſt theſe contentionswere acting, with no ſmal violence of all ſides, to the contentment (if not amazement) of many other Princes, that eſteemed the differences a king of ſafety to themſelves. The unwiſe Iſland of <hi>Creete,</hi> believing they might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain recover, either all or ſome part of their loſt priviledges, (pretending they were obſtructed in their religion) not long after entred into open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. To tell you, that the maine motives of their riſings, proceeded from the inſtigations of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Delphos,</hi> is not an improbable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; ſince as the one in a ceremonious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Flamins, declared the Queen an accurſed enemy to his rights and juriſdiction, ſo did the other ſend Forces into <hi>Creet,</hi> to ſtrengthen the people in their pretentions; which however theſe aſſiſtances, ſeemed not to prevaile entirely againſt the Queens governours in the Iſland, yet appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently they procured her officers, ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances from time to time, that however ſhee neither failed them with ſupplies, or was wanting to them in counſels, yet for many yeeres together, the rebels kept a conſiderable body in the field, in deſpight of all the Queens forces.</p>
                  <p>In this manner theſe contentions continued
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98927:165"/>many yeeres; for as the Queen ſeemed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtick ſpleene, to be enflamed with her ſubjects diſobedience, ſo were her ſubjects in their rage animated by meſſengers ſent from <hi>Delphos,</hi> to put them alwaies in minde of their religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations: whereunto being added their hate to the <hi>Lydian</hi> government, and the confidence they had of <hi>Aegypts</hi> aſſiſtance, they ſeemed often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to have received a new ſpirit of valour, contrary to their nature and cuſtome; however for the moſt part, they rather made uſe of their ſubtilty, in ſending out ſmall parties to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and entrap the enemy, then being willing at any time to hazard in the field a main battell, to decide the controverſie; which was the reaſon the warre was ſo long prolonged, with ſeverall ſuceeſſes of either ſide: for as the <hi>Creetans</hi> had the advantage, of perfectly knowing the country, amongſt woods and bogs, ſo had the <hi>Lydians</hi> a great deale the better in their conduct and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: but which way ſoever buſineſſes went, as the rebels were conducted by a Nobleman of the Nation, whoſe family and name was as great amongſt the people, as his ſpleen and courage was againſt the Queen, ſo became the State of <hi>Lydia</hi> exceeding weary of the warre; being moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the money disburſed in the contention, would never by any conqueſt ſhe could make of the Iſland, be again repayd into her coffers: wherefore, after ſome deliberation it was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to ſend over a principall Favourite of the Queens, whereby to put the ſooner an end by his authority and fidelity, to thoſe chargeable and
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98927:165"/>bloudy differences, that not onely deſtroyed her people in the Iſland of <hi>Creete,</hi> but diſquieted her own government in the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia:</hi> and the rather was it ſo determined, for that ſhe had been perſwaded, that the ſouldiers of her army in this Iſland, lengthned the warre on purpoſe, for their own benefit and command; knowing, when that ſhould be once abſolutely finiſhed, their eſteeme at court, would fall with their want of imployment in the field: but contrary to her expectation, this favourite of hers having more ambition then foreſight, (ſince he was ſent away onely by his enemies, to ſeparate him from the Queenes perſon) as alſo being more vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious in his thoughts, then experienced in his yeeres (and ſo conſequently not having much knowledge either of the Countrey, or the enemy) after a moſt vaſt expence of money, and nothing in a manner acted againſt the Rebels, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again into <hi>Lydia,</hi> with diſgrace and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; which at laſt by reaſon of his ſubtill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries practices, that undermined him in the Queens favour, he loſt his head upon a ſcaffold, by the common Executioner; in whoſe place notwithſtanding, ſuch a brave perſonage was ſent, that in a very ſhort ſpace, reduced the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to ſo much neceſſary reaſon, both in their perſons and eſtates, that they offered quietly to ſubmit to mercy, without either condition or contention. This being entertained, and the people ready in all places to lay down armes, the Queen her ſelfe ſuddenly changes her own habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation here, for a more laſting one in another
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98927:166"/>world; that made all things at a ſtand for a time. But as <hi>Euarchus</hi> father met with no oppoſition, in that poſſeſſion that belonged unto him with ſo much juſtice, ſo upon his firſt entrance into <hi>Lydia,</hi> hee was preſented with an abſolute ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, not onely of the great Noblemen of our Iſland, that had for many yeeres contended with the Queen, but alſo of all his party, that were neither few in number, or penurious in fortunes. Nevertheleſſe, although this King was mercifull enough in his diſpoſition, as well to pardon all faults, as to forget former diſaffections, yet the hungry <hi>Miſſians</hi> his naturall countreymen, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the forfeitures of the Iſland of <hi>Creete,</hi> by reaſon of the late rebellions, were not of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew, to be returned back again to the owners, without ſome profits made thereby; and finding the ſcituation and fertility of the countrey able to make full reparation to their greedy ſtomacks, for the defects and ſterility of their own habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not onely perſwaded the King, that his act of mercy would prove of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to rebellious diſpoſitions hereafter, but obtained at his hands, ſo many grants of poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Iſland, that gave them ſufficient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency and authority, to tranſport a great part of their own people hither, where being eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed after a while with peace and ſecurity, by their induſtry, joyned together with their power, they ſoon outed moſt of the inhabitants of their eſtates; and at laſt took from all in generall both their liberty and religion; in ſo much as many ancient families were either turned a begging in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:98927:166"/>their own Countrey, or forced to ſeek ſervile offices in other parts, for ſubſiſtance. This,; muſt ſay, is the common allegation of the natives and in part true, although I muſt confeſſe much of their miſeries proceeded from their lazy diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions (as I have formerly ſaid) that would not permit them, to equall other Nations in painfull endeavour; rather chuſing in their natures to be wanderers, then become willing to ſubmit their perſons under the juriſdiction of better cuſtomes. But be it what it will, in this condition they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained without any power at all to act, untill the beginning of theſe differences, between our King <hi>Euarchus,</hi> and his great Senate; when the people, (not having altogether forgot their old hate to the <hi>Lydians,</hi> and now finding ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to expreſſe it) began anew to flie out; however the particular cauſes were theſe: When the <hi>Myſſians</hi> firſt proclaimed their diſlike, by leading Armies to oppoſe Kingly authority in their own Nation, one <hi>Polinex,</hi> once governour of this Iſland (though ſince deſtroyed for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) prepared a company of expert ſouldiers, to be imployed againſt the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> as eſteeming them moſt proper to the purpoſe, in regard of their hate to thoſe people: but, not to detaine you over long by needleſſe repetitions, and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things which are onely conjecturall, After that our King, <hi>Euarchus,</hi> in a manner had committed the mannagement of affaires into the hands of his great Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> it was not held either needfull by way of oppoſition, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient by reaſon of the expence, to continue afoot
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:98927:167"/>thoſe ſouldiers, that had been leavied and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Polinex,</hi> in this Iſland of <hi>Creete;</hi> wherefore orders were preſently ſent to disband the Troops; but in ſome ſort nevertheleſſe to give them ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, leſt they might prove dangerous and troubleſome to the government, they gave them what liberty they pleaſed, to contract with other Princes, for their future entertainment in ſome forraigne warres. However the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> when they perceived the ſouldiers were thus by bargain to be tranſported; either fearing their returne in a body to their prejudice, or rather (I may ſay) envying all felicity of theirs, made earneſt ſuit to the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> (with whom then they held a moſt intimate correſpondency) not to ſuffer them to goe out of the Kingdome. As theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions prevailed, before the conſideration of the contract made for their tranſportation, ſo the people of this Iſland; being not onely inflamed with theſe injurious proceedings, as they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, but alſo fearing an utter extirpation of the whole Nation, by reaſon of the malice and practices of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> of a ſudden (having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred before into many conſultations amongſt themſelves) began as well to make uſe of thoſe armes they were already provided of, as to ſeize into their hands many ſtrong Townes in the Countrey; however in the interim, they ſet forth many Proclamations in their own defence; which in effect were to this purpoſe, that in regard the King himſelfe had in a manner loſt all his owne prerogative, whereby he was formerly impowred to govern; they in their own behalfes now were
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:98927:167"/>neceſſitated, to take up armes for their preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both againſt <hi>Myſſia</hi> &amp; the Kingdom of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that ſought not onely the aboliſhing of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but an extirpation of their perſons: but however theſe pretentions were plauſible enough; and perhaps no otherwiſe meant by them at the firſt, yet the outragious violence committed of both ſides, ſoon drew many Commanders of <hi>Greete</hi> from other parts, who inſtead of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their endeavours in making onely a defenſive war, they violently perſwaded the people to ſtand upon their own pretended priviledges before the conqueſt; as having either Kings of their proper Nation, or at leaſtwiſe no ſtrangers to command over them; whilſt they themſelves alſo began to challenge old Dignities &amp; Titles, with the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of moſt of the Lands in the Countrey, that for many yeeres had belonged to other perſons and families, that perhaps had bought them to them and their heires, at moſt valuable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable rates. This in a very ſhort ſpace ſet the whole Iſland in ſuch a burning and outragious flame, that ſlaughters of ſuch execrable natures were committed, (to the very horrour, as I may ſay, of mankind) both my ſelfe, and ſome other Noblemen of the Countrey were forced to take up armes, not onely for the defence of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and eſtates, but to bring the people of both ſides to a better temper: wherin, for my own part, as I uſed what moderation I could in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon my conntrey-men, at what time ſo ever I gained any victories over them, (which truly was not very ſeldom) ſo by this means their hatred
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98927:168"/>began to be augmented towards me as againſt a <hi>Myſſian</hi> enemy: in ſo much as they began to form orderly councels of their part, as we did entertain with regularity thoſe ſupplies were ſent us out of <hi>Lydia;</hi> for however they had the greateſt part of the Countrey at their diſpoſe, yet we held the moſt commodious for our parpoſe; things reſting in doubtfull though bloudy conflicts, untill the differences between our King <hi>Euarchus,</hi> and the Senate now remaining at <hi>Sardis,</hi> began to take up new conſiderations, in the thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites of all ſorts of people, that had any relation to the <hi>Lydian</hi> government; wherefore the King having drawn armies into the field for his own pretended defence, as the Senate had raiſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to contend againſt his intentions, the ſouldiers under my command, being more deſirous to ſerve in the <hi>Lydian</hi> wars, where gaine and honour were (as they thought to be obtained) then to remaine here without either pay or benefit, both they and my ſelfe in a particular way, endeavoured to ſerve the King againſt his Senate; and of a ſudden, ſhuffling up a truce with the Rebels in theſe parts, upon their faithfull promiſes, not onely to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Princes pleaſure, upon reaſonable conditions, but further to aſſiſt him in his preſent warres, both with their perſons and eſtates, I ſent all the ſouldiers preſently to the Kings armies, keeping in the interim this Town, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under my juriſdiction, to be diſpoſed of as he ſhall at any time appoint. In fine, as this is as ſhort a relation as I can make of thoſe accidents, that have befallen our unhappy countrey, from
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98927:168"/>the beginning of the <hi>Lydian</hi> rule, ſo cannot I but eſteem my ſelfe extreamly ſatisfied for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that although it hath not yet come within the compaſſe of my ability, to doe the King any remarkable or profitable ſervices; that the Princeſs <hi>Cloria</hi> is not only her ſelfe in perſon, come under the power of that command I hold under her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that her diſtreſſes and neceſſities at ſea alſo have been in part, relieved by the naturall ſcituation of this Iſland of <hi>Creete,</hi> which as a good and lucke <hi>Omen,</hi> will preſerve it hence forward, I hope from deſtruction, if not grant it a better bleſſing, then lately it hath received from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the heavens; and with theſe word, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſuch a look, that was capable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to win beliefe, concerning his affectionate endeavours to the King, he ended his diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana,</hi> after ſhe had returned the Governour thanks, with two or three ſighes, to expreſſe in a ſort her inward ſorrow for the accidents, as it were both pittying the people, and doubting the event, (ſince as <hi>Dedalus</hi> himſelfe ſeemed not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confident of his power, ſo had ſhe heard of many factions in the Iſland:) ſhe deſired him, that he would be yet pleaſed, to augment ſo farre her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation, as in a few more words, added to his further trouble, to let her know, how the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt at preſent ſtood in the countrey, as well in regard of the King, as the Senate; for that himſelfe appeared not to have (as ſhe ſaid) an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute command through the whole Iſland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dedalus</hi> ſoon replyed, That as he could not much brag of the affections of the inhabitants,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98927:169"/>concerning his own particular perſon (not onely in regard he had given them, as he ſaid many deſperate overthrowes, in their late contentions; but for that he was not of the ſame opinions with them in the worſhip of the gods; upon the which they ſeemed to ground their chief diſlikes againſt both King and Senate) ſo could he eaſily reſolve her, that the countrey in the generall was divided into three factions: the firſt, being for the King intirely; the ſecond enclined to the ancient na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and the third was wholy addicted to the Senates intereſt, but whether in the end will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, ſaid he, the gods onely can informe; ſince, however the firſt ſeemes to have the beſt right, yet the two remaining exceed in power and probability: the one being better furniſhed with money and proviſions, as the others are accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with numbers and violence. As he was about to proceed in his diſcourſe, they were both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed of the return of thoſe meſſengers, that had been ſent to enquire after the ſafety of the other ſhip wherein <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was; who being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently called into their preſence, one of them gave this ſhort account of their voyage by Sea: having for many daies, ſaid he, not oneiy coaſted ſeverall Iſlands belonging to <hi>Greece,</hi> but much alſo of the continent appertaining to the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> we could have no newes ar all of any ſuch veſſell, either ſhipwrackt, or put into harbour; untill at laſt by chance we met with a Merchant of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> going for <hi>Carthage,</hi> who informed us, that for certain before his departure from that City, a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſhip both with <hi>Syrian</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:98927:169"/>was arrived in the chiefe haven belonging to the Iſland, however much beaten and torn with the weather: but what people or commodities were contained in her, he ſaid he could not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme us, in reſpect he himſelfe was under ſaile upon his departure, when that ſhip came in.</p>
                  <p>The Meſſenger alſo added further, that a great fleet of <hi>Lydian</hi> veſſels, that were newly come upon the ſeas lay between <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which hindred them for the preſent, for making any further enquiry or experiment, ſince if they ſhould have approached the Iſland, as he ſaid, it had been almoſt impoſſible to have eſcaped, by reaſon they could not but have eaſily been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be of King <hi>Euarchus</hi> party: it is not to be doubted, but as this intelligence ſufficiently ſatisfied them, concerning the ſafety of the other ſhip, ſo did they haſte to the Princeſſe chamber with the Meſſengers, to give her information of the expedition, which for the preſent hindred the period of <hi>Dedalus</hi> relation, concerning the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Iſland, according to his intention.</p>

                  <p>Theſe attempts I muſt ſay, extreamely divided the inhabitants both in their actions and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for as the more moderate ſort of people (eſpecially thoſe that had any correſpondency with the <hi>Lydians,</hi> either by extraction or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce) were willing enough to continue the old government, and retaine both their lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes they had formerly uſed, ſo the violenter part of the Natives, that had time out of minde contracted a certaine kinde of barbariſme in their manners and diſpoſitions, would heare of no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, but what was preſcribed them by a few commanders, that were ſent from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Warres, who ſeemed onely to comply with the religion of <hi>Deſphos</hi> for their owne ends: The people I may affirme with ſome confidence, were ſo far tranſported, &amp; infatuated with this ſpight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ambition (their governours in the interim, ſuppoſing they ſhould be made petty Princes in command, amongſt the more ignorant ſort of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) that they did not onely decline violently all manner of reaſonable accords, but even were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to hate with an exact ſpleene and malice, all their owne country men, friends and kindred,

                  <p>Theſe Tranſactions I ſay, filled the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try a new with bloud and ſlaughters; and the more confuſed it proved; (and ſo conſequently the more horrid) in regard that for the moſt part, we fought dividedly upon the generall ſcore of three intereſts; ſometimes two againſt one, &amp; then againe each for it ſelfe, as often as any oppoſition was found, which not ſeldome hapned, in regard of the many jealouſies and ſuſpicions, riſing daily
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98927:175"/>out of the variety of apprehenſions by reaſon of frequent accidents: ſo that in a ſhort time, almoſt in every place the Townes were fired, the people deſtroyed, and the countrey depopulated; being no ſafety in any place, or ſcarce the leaſt meanes of ſubſiſtance out of Armies, unleſſe it were under the walls, and protection of ſome few garriſons, that ſecured a kind of ſmall circuit, for neceſſary proviſions, to maintain themſelves and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of their juriſdiction: but the King at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from me and others intelligence of theſe lamentable proceedings, in the Iſland of <hi>Creet</hi> (as truly in a manner it was paſt all examples, ſince the intention of all ſides, was not alone to contend about diſputable rights, occaſioned by ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer oppreſſion, but even to extirpate not onely whole families, but the very remembrance of the Nation it ſelfe, that ſhould have the unhappineſſe to be overcome by the other) gave order to me if it were poſſible to reconcile theſe bloudy diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and horrid contentions, with all the ſpeed I could, ſpecially amongſt thoſe of his own party, neither was he determintd to exclude out of this number the old <hi>Cretans</hi> themſelves, however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon other intereſts, onely in regard they ſeemed by their declarations formerly in words, to ſtand for his Tide and authority, againſt the proceedings of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> though publickly, they contended violently with his Forces in the field: 'Tis true I cannot deny but in ſome things they had reaſon enough for their jealouſies, the King very often being conſtrained, to goe even from his own reſolutions, to give ſatisfaction to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98927:176"/>thoſe Councels that were continually about his perſon; who perſwaded him, he loſt the love of his people in <hi>Lydia,</hi> by ſeeming in any kind to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or countenance the <hi>Cretans</hi> in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, who as they pretended were enemies to their general eſtabliſhed religion; Of the other ſide the Natives were againe by much too cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and miſtruſtfull not onely to deſire violently other mens poſſeſſions and eſtates from them, but ſo entirely to doubt the Kings performance of his promiſes, when as they knew he did but endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for his better advantage, to contract private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them in moſt particulars, in ſuch matters as appertained to the Temple of <hi>Delphos,</hi> for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as I ſaid too generall a diſtaſt, to thoſe of his owne party, within the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia.</hi> But to be ſhort, it was not very long, before the King ſent a moſt intimate councellor of his owne into the Iſland of <hi>Creet,</hi> as well to informe me particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of his pleaſure by word of mouth, as alſo to Joyne himſelfe with me and others in commiſſion for the better and ſpeedier effecting of his deſignes: preſently as ſoone as hee arrived, we ſent out our ſummons to the whole Countrey in the generall, either to meet themſelves, or to appoint Deputies for each diviſion in the Iſland, to attend the Kings orders and direction upon a certaine day at <hi>Pergame,</hi> not onely to heare what ſhould be propounded in their Princes behalfe, for their future peace and advantage, but alſo we our ſelves would be ready to heare what the people would demand, to their further ſatisfaction, whereby their enemies, the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> might be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98927:176"/>in their intentions; who endeavoured not onely to beat downe all Kingly authority in the Iſland, but to become abſolute Lords, over all the inhabitants ancient liberties: I muſt tell you, whilſt we expected a joyfull iſſue of theſe purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, we underſtood another great Lord of <hi>Lydia,</hi> was newly arrived with certaine directions as was pretended from the King, independent to that power was granted us, whereby as we were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, onely himſelfe was impowred underhand, to deale more intimately with the inhabitants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters of religion: as this ſomething ſtartled our expectation having no ſuch notice from the King, ſo did we reſolve to ſend for the party upon our authority, who upon his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, neither obeying our commands, nor giving us the ſatisfaction was deſired, we at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſtrained his perſon, untill the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in that particular (as we ſaid) ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly knowne: but whether theſe proceedings of ours (which however we eſteemed for the beſt) or that the Natives in truth were otherwiſe ſetled in their reſolutions, hindred the ſucceſſe, when the day came according to the appointment for this aſſembly to meet, there appeared none at all of the ancient inhabitants of the Country, ſo that upon ſome concluſion of a few things between us and the reſt of the <hi>Cretans,</hi> who were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ſpightfull againſt the <hi>Lydian</hi> cuſtomes as the others, we for the preſent diſſolved any further Treaty, which in a manner is as much as I can ſay of our preſent ſtate and affaires, untill I ſhall be better inſtructed, either by the Natives inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> as ſhe had beene very attentive to all <hi>Dedalus</hi> diſcourſe, for that ſhee was extreamely deſirous to informe her ſelfe in what particulars ſhe could, concerning the paſſages of the Iſland, ſo when he had abſolutely made an end of what he would ſay, ſhe uſed theſe words unto him, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Lord, ſaid ſhe, I muſt needs confeſſe, this ſeemes to my imagination to be a moſt unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Country in the generall, if not to be threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſome deſperate fate from the heavens, to its deſtruction: however of the other ſide, it ſeems ſomething doubtfull as yet to my apprehenſion in what things the Natives are ſo much to blame according to many mens thoughts, ſince it is but reaſonable, as the King is to expect from them their fidelity and aſſiſtance, ſo they ſhould in ſome ſort, be aſſured in their religion and poſſeſſions; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in a conjuncture of times when there are ſo many enemies of all parts that conſpire their ruine; not onely in reſpect of the <hi>Myſſians</hi> that are in open hoſtility againſt them, but in regard alſo of thoſe that attend abour <hi>Evarchus</hi> perſon at the Court; who are no way inclinable as you have already intimated to favour their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings or intereſt. Truly Madam anſwered <hi>Deda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> if there were no more in it then thoſe generals you mention, there might be much ſaid in their behalfes, but being pleaſed to admit ſo farre of a tedious diſcourſe, that I may a little take apart the particulars of their demands, I make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98927:177"/>but you will eaſily perceive, that as they were unreaſonable, to exact from the Kings ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities ſuch conditions, ſo was it unpoſſible for him to grant them their deſires, without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering in a manner the whole frame of his affairs, both in <hi>Lydia</hi> and <hi>Creet</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dedalus</hi> finding, that <hi>Roxana</hi> was moſt willing to heare all his arguments for her better ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he began thus to diſpute: Firſt, ſaid he for their propoſitions mentioned, not onely to have a free liberty to exerciſe their owne Countrey rights, in the worſhip of the gods, according to the uſe of <hi>Delphos,</hi> but to have moſt of the chiefe Temples, belonging to the Iſland delivered into their hands, with all the rents and revenues belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging unto them, it cannot but evidently appeare to all knowing judgements, what a diſtraction it would ſoone have made in <hi>Creet,</hi> when as in many places moſt of the inhabitants themſelves, are contrary in their opinions to thoſe principles, whereupon would follow a moſt deſperate confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion amongſt all ſorts of people; when ſuch ſhould be of a ſuddaine, debarred of the uſuall place of their ſacrificing to the gods, by thoſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly were ſubject to their lawes and cuſtomes; and much more ſtrange and diſtaſtfull it would be, to have the maintenance of all their Prieſts and Flamins (being for the moſt part <hi>Lydians</hi> by birth) taken from them, and they turned with their whole families into the world without any ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance at all, after ſo long a time of poſſeſſion and ſettlement: beſides it is very well knowne, many of the Noblemen and Gentry of the Country it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98927:178"/>ſelfe, upon whoſe fidelity and power the Kings preſent affaires depended, were actually veſted in a great part of thoſe Titles and rents (in a manner beyond any remembrance) either by gift or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe: who no doubt upon ſuch a diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagable change, meerly out of ſpleene and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte, would have quickly turned their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and affections, to the countenancing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of the <hi>Myſſians</hi> proceedings, againſt <hi>Evar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> their Prince: In the next place whereas they demanded, that either no ſtrange governours ſhould be appointed over any part of the Iſland, but meerly Natives, or at leaſtwiſe ſuch as ſhould be approved by the generall councell inſtituted by themſelves, I pray conſider but with indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which I know you doe, what an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary (and I may ſay) a moſt prepoſterous incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, it would have brought upon the Kings deſignes, not onely by reaſon of thoſe contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinions, it would have created in all mens minds concerning his actions and want of ſpirit, but alſo have given ſo generall a diſtaſt to all his Subjects of beſt quality in both Kingdomes, that the effects muſt needs have beene of a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence, when as the principall men of honour ſhould be abſolutely outed, both of their preſent command or future expectation, to give way to the advancement of ſuch people, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knew well how to governe when they ſhould be imployed, or the King himſelfe could be at all certaine of their fidelitie, when they were in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; as well in regard of the fantaſticall inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of their own natures and diſpoſitions; as alſo
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98927:178"/>in reſpect of their ſeverall intereſts depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other Nations. And laſt of all, whereas it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, that all thoſe lands be againe reſtored to the ancient Natives of the Iſland, which had beene at any time forfeited, for what pretended rebellion ſoever, either in the raigne of the father of <hi>Evar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> or the old Queene of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the poſſeſſion of any <hi>Lydians</hi> or <hi>Myſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> would have proved as dangerous an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to the Kings affaires, as any other thing we have yet mentioned; and in truth would have beene a worke (beſides the generall diſtaſte) of a moſt ſtupendious labour to have effected: not onely in regard of the ſeverall intricate Titles, that muſt of neceſſily depend upon the long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of them from one family to another, by reaſon of alienations and bargaines of diverse natures and manners, made betweene man and man, but alſo would be a moſt difficult matter for the Natives themſelves, juſtly to diſtribute with an indifferent equality and content, to each party who ſhould make their demands, ſince as many would pretend to what was none of their owne, ſo others againe being but very young (if at all then borne) when their anceſtors loſt the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their eſtates, (the property of them being alſo ſince that time changed, either by cutting down of woods, erecting of building, or peopling of Townes and Villages) would be defrauded of their dues, for want of certaine knowledge, what belonged to their Parents: beſides how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of families, would be turned to a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable begging poſture? who as Tennants to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98927:179"/>their Lords, had laid out their money of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable valew upon purchaſes, either for lives or yeares, and knew not where to ſeeke other habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with their wives and children for their ſubſiſtance; neither truly could the Natives make any conſiderable profit of the ſaid lands, for want of people to mannure them, ſince it is very well knowne, they in their owne perſons are not any way husbandmen, or at all induſtrious without the <hi>Lydian</hi> aſſiſtance; wherefore conſequently, this courſe and alteration muſt bring a generall devaſtation upon the whole Countrey: but put caſe ſome would readily yield to theſe orders and in junctions, by reaſon of quietneſſe and poſſeſſion, yet no doubt but the moſt part would oppoſe, being by birth or extraction either <hi>Myſſians</hi> or <hi>Lydians,</hi> which of neceſſity would procure confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion enough, as alſo be a meanes that <hi>Evarchus</hi> enemies, would diſpoſſeſſe all his friends under their juriſdiction in like manner, whereſoever they had gained by their ſwords any thing over the Kings fortunes in <hi>Lydia, Myſſia,</hi> or <hi>Creet.</hi> Of the other ſide, if we doe but conſider, the ſmall aide and aſſiſtance, theſe people could have affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their Prince at the beſt, we ſhall find theſe conceſſions (upon the matter) would have beene wholly loſt, ſince they undertooke onely, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him ten thouſand men to be imployed in his Warres, without paying them for any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time; and the gods know perhaps, they would not fully have performed thoſe promiſes; being as uncertaine in their undertakings, as unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their demands: No no, Madam, ſaid he,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98927:179"/>theſe were but meer chymeras, broached by ſome of their eminent commanders for their own ends, to render themſelves great and potent amongſt the people, and afterward would have made uſe of their power, as their anceſtors did before them, to no other purpoſe but to exerciſe Tyranny and nouriſh rebellion: And however, I ſay, that the meſſenger ſent from <hi>Delphos</hi> ſeemed to concurre in theſe deſignes, yet I will not ſay he erred, ſo much in will and intention, as out of ignorance and want of judgement: nevertheleſſe though he imagined onely perhaps to reduce the inhabitants to their ancient obedience to the Temple of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos,</hi> without prejudicing much others rights, yet his complying ſo much with their rude and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous cuſtomes in outward ſhew, according to the old Natives humours; with his publickly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing all others of a more civill conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, notwithſtanding they profeſſed the ſame religion and worſhip of the gods, gave not onely cauſe of too much ſuſpition, concerning his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and purpoſes, but occaſioned a great deale of confuſion and diſtraction in the generall as well to the overthrow of the Kings Intereſt, as to the hazard of the Natives ſubſiſtance in their owne Country, in regard of the advantages their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies the <hi>Myſſians</hi> make of their differences. But heare a meſſenger ſent from the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> ſtopt their further diſcourſe, who as he ſaid deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeake with <hi>Roxana:</hi> ſo that the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, onely thanking <hi>Dedalus</hi> for what was paſt; and promiſing too meet him often upon the ſame ſubject, made haſt to know her Miſtreſſes pleaſure:</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98927:180"/>
                  <p>When <hi>Roxana</hi> came into her Chamber, the Princeſſe told her, that ſhe had beene lately trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a moſt untoward and fearefull dreame, which however in her thoughts ſhe was not at all ſuperſtitious as ſhee ſaid, yet ſhee could not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely free her apprehenſion from the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it: ſhee imagined her ſelfe and <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to be upon the Sea together in one Veſſell, when of a ſudden an extreame darkneſſe ſeemed to cover the face of the water, in ſo much as they could not perceive any thing at all about them, whereupon both of them remaining frighted, with a kind of horrour to ſee ſo great an unexpected change in the weather, from a cleare Sun-ſhine-day, to a time almoſt as black as night, they might at laſt behold themſelves incompaſſed round about with many ſhips, belonging to the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> that bid them preſently yield to that power without reſiſtance, unleſſe they would hazzard their owne deſtructions: ſo that inſtantly conceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no way able to reſiſt ſo peremptory a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, their perſons were preſently not onely ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, but ſeparated with a great deale of cruelty one from another, to their no ſmall griefe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, whilſt in the interim alſo ſhee heard ſome of the company ſay, that as this deſigne was put in execution, by the authority of young <hi>Philos Philoſtros</hi> nephew, ſo was it his pleaſure to have her ſelfe carried priſoner into her fathers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> as he was reſolved to diſpoſe of the perſon of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> according to his owne will and intentions in the Kingdome of <hi>Syria:</hi> preſently upon the apprehenſion of the dreame (as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98927:180"/>ſhee ſaid) ſhee wakened, with ſome kinde of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming trouble more then ordinary as the people about her had informed her her:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> finding her Miſtreſſe notwithſtanding her profeſſions, to be ſomething diſcompoſed, either by reaſon of the diſtempers of her ſickneſſe, or in regard of the diſtraction of her apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, having belike before ſhee went to ſleep, filled her imagination with ſome unprofitable thoughts proceeding from the diſcourſe of former actions or conceptions, told her, that as it was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt folly in the world (if not a moſt ſupreame impiety) to put any manner of confidence or beliefe in dreames unpleaſant, that were ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred onely in the fancy by meere accidents, mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the indiſpoſition of the body, ſo if the gods at any time had a will, we ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in things to come neceſſary to be known, they would certainly ſend us for true informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Oracles, that are not to be held fallible in any kind: of the contrary, the motions that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from our ſelves are for the moſt part gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by paſſions; and ſo conſequently not to be relyed upon, although ſometimes I cannot deny ſaid ſhee but they happen accordingly, though no otherwiſe then like as a perſon ſhould caſt a ſtone over a houſe, and by meere fortune might kill a bird of the other ſide; for though the ſtone had but that one place to light in to doe the thing, yet by meere fortune it might as well light there as any where elſe: but however this ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, reaſonably well quieted the Princeſſes thoughts for the preſent; yet both ſhee and

                     <hi>Roxana</hi> fell upon a reſolution, with all poſſible ſpeed to haſte their journey towards the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> as well for that they doubted not, but to meet <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to their extraordinary content and ſatisfaction there; as of the other ſide, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Creet</hi> to be a place of ſufficient ſecurity any long time, in regard of thoſe many factions and diſturbances in the country, depending upon ſeverall intereſts, according to the relations of <hi>Dedalus</hi> the governour; for beſides the inconſtant natures of the people, with the ſmall authority the King ſeemed to have by way of juriſdiction, over the very actions and affaires of his own party (as they were informed) could they be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry confident of the fidelity of the City of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game,</hi> where they for the preſent remained; in regard the Senate of <hi>Lydia</hi> by occaſion of Trade, ſeemed to have a kinde of hidden influence, in the thoughts and affections of moſt of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: nevertheleſſe, although <hi>Cloria</hi> and her go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſſe might have theſe paſſionate deſires, of removing with all expedition, yet neither the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Princeſſe, or the commodity of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Veſſell that had conveyed them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as yet afforded them the conveniency.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98927:182"/>to their wonted and ancient obedience, to that juriſdiction he held under the King his maſter, as ſuppoſing neither their ſtrengh or skill, would long be able to contend with his right and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: but alaſſe, they had already too craftily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his purpoſes, by more preventing deſignes; for as ſoone as they fell upon theſe reſolutions, to keep him by ſtrong hand out of the Towne, they ſent privately to thoſe <hi>Lydian</hi> ſhips that lay diſperſed over the Seas, with a full declaration of their intentions, which was to render themſelves obedient to the Senat's commands; of which a conſiderable number was already come into the Haven, to take poſſeſſion of the City, whereby to receive the peoples offers in that nature, with a promiſe alſo of their parts, to afford them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection both in war and peace, againſt all thoſe that ſhould oppoſe: This being ſoon made known to <hi>Dedalus,</hi> he had no other way, but to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the beſt conditions he could both for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and the Princeſſe, to which effect Commiſ-miſſioners of each fide were appointed to Treat; ſince as he could not altogether have declined this remedy, ſo with no probable hope, could he have expected the gaining of the Towne by force, in regard of thoſe ſupplies which remained in the ſhips newly come into the Haven, to ſtrengthen the inhabitants endeavours and reſolutions; of the other ſide, being obliged to lye with all his Forces in the Fields before the Walls of <hi>Pergame,</hi> without either ſupplyes or proviſion, he was in certaine danger to be deſtroyed by the old Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, who not many dayes before by his valour

                  <p>However the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> when ſhee came to the aſſured knowledge of theſe unfortunate paſſages, by which her owne liberty ſeemed again to be circumſcribed, by a new though a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour juriſdiction, although ſhee could not be but ſufficiently ſenſible of the unhappineſſe of ſuch a ſubjection, yet ſhee reſolved to meet her captivity with ſuch a majeſty, as either would bring revenge upon her perſon, in regard of her Fathers contentions, or procure a reſpectfull compaſſion from her enemies, that might defend her Dignity from all oppreſſion: with theſe thoughts (as if ſhee had beene of a ſudden mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly cured of her diſtempers) ſhee called for her Clothes, whereby the better to put her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious determinations in execution, when any violence to that purpoſe ſhould be attempted: but <hi>Roxana</hi> upon the inſtant comming in to her chamber, and finding her body not in a capacity to anſwer to that reſolution of her minde, not onely gave her counſell to lye ſtill, and expect as yet the farther event of things during the Treaty, but alſo entered into more neceſſary diſcourſes with her, concerning what was to be thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and done, in this unlucky conjuncture of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires; although ſhee could not apprehend much danger would happen, either to her perſon or quality by this accident: To this purpoſe ſhee uſed this language unto her as ſhee lay in her bed: Madam ſaid ſhee, put the worſt, which is to be made priſoners to this new power, that as you

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98927:184"/>of your deſires, after all your ſtrange and ſeverall adventures; eſteeming it as a full ſatisfaction from the gods, in recompence of your ſo many troubles and hazards: neither let it ever enter into your thoughts, that the Senate of <hi>Lydia</hi> will in any kinde, either endanger your perſon or reſtraine your liberty; for that, as ſuch intentions would afford them no manner of benefit whatſoever, in their contentions with the King your Father (ſince there are already many of the royall Iſſue out of their power and poſſeſſion) ſo would it not onely cauſe a more generall hate upon their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons throughout all <hi>Aſia,</hi> but highly exaſperate your Uncle <hi>Orſames</hi> againſt their proceedings; to the endangering certainely, of a new Warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> which no doubt but the Senate will endeavour to prevent, by all meanes poſſible they can invent.</p>

                  <p>'Tis true <hi>Roxana</hi> caſt about many wayes in her working thoughts, how yet to alter or prevent theſe determinations of carrying the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> into <hi>Lydia</hi> a priſoner: firſt ſhee fancies to ſteale out of the Towne, to thoſe Forces which <hi>Dedalus</hi> had in a body entire without the Walls; and notwithſtanding the agreement to animate their ſpirits to ſtand for the Kings right and the Princeſſe ſafety: but finding they both needed neceſſary proviſions, and were in danger in their perſons hourely to be cut off by the old <hi>Cretans,</hi> that lay every where diſperſed over the whole Countrey; who hated them as they knew equall with the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> ſhee thought that would be a project of no great conſequence to their benefit; then againe ſhee imagined, that perchance they might uſe ſome ſtratagem, to be conveyed pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately out of the Haven, by ſome hired ſhip to that purpoſe; and by that meanes concealedly get into the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> according to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intentions: however when ſhee remembred ſhe was told, that the officers of the Senates forces, had lately not onely taken a ſtrict account of all the Veſſels that remained in the Harbour, but had

                  <p>And laſtly ſhe conceited, that perchance they might find not onely reception but protection in the Armies of the ancient Natives: but when ſhe confidered the inconſtancy of their diſpoſitions, the rudeneſſe of their cuſtomes, with their ſeveral particular intereſts, ſhe thought it a vanity, if not a madneſſe to put in execution any ſuch deſigne, and the rather for that the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> her ſelfe, was not yet ſo perfectly recovered of her health, that ſhe could poſſibly expoſe her perſon to thoſe uncertainties, both in travel, &amp; dyet, with other inconveniences, that ſhe would neceſſarily be obliged to ſuffer amongſt thoſe unpolliſht Troopes: wherefore the old woman being in her opinion convinced in all theſe particulars, ſhee perſwaded her Miſtreſſe, with a kinde of a majeſty mixt with affability and kindneſſe, to entertaine both her fortunes, and thoſe Commanders that ſhould be deſigned to conduct her under the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Senate, ſince as yet they could not by any meanes leame what probably might be reſolved of, concerning the farther diſpoſure of their perſons, upon their arrivall in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Lydia.</hi>

Nevertheleſſe poore <hi>Caſſa</hi> was to be made the object of his ſpleen, ſince <hi>Briſania</hi> would not be the ſubject of his love; for ſome few dayes after he was brought to a publicke ſcaffold erected before the Caſtle window, where <hi>Briſania</hi> remained, that ſhe might be the better witneſſe of the bloudy Tragedy intended; <hi>Caſſa</hi> appeared in a mourning habit, becomming the ſadneſſe of his preſent condition, but much more clouded in his ſorrowfull countenance, that ſhewed his dejected minde; though his beauty had yet ſo large a poſſeſſion in his perſon by the opinion of the people, that he ſeemed a Sun ſhaded in a dark skie, that notwithſtanding ſhot forth bright beames under the blacke coverture; And in this manner was lead to the Theater of death in the view of the people, who accompanied him all the way with their liberall lamentation, ſince theſe were the onely ſacrifices they could offer in his behalfe; for although he was eſteemed amongſt them but a private Gentleman of <hi>Iberia,</hi> yet could they not chuſe but grieve to ſee a Youth of his naturall perfections, untimely brought to his deſtruction, by the cruelty of a wicked Tyrant: But in the meane time poore <hi>Briſania</hi> ſummoned to the ſpectacle by the noyſe of the ſpectators, at the firſt ſight began to feele new paſſions in her gentle boſome, not ſo much of love as pitty, ſince the priſoner himſelfe had by divers meſſages ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited her to yield, rather then to make him the onely object of <hi>Fridius</hi> his hate: wherefore, firſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98927:189"/>ſhe laid before her thoughts the innocency of the priſoner that was to ſuffer, onely becauſe ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued wilfull. Then ſhe began to thinke there was nothing but her own miſerable captivity could redeem his life, religion, charity and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pleaded of one ſide, as hatred, honour, and courage contended of the other, which made her ſometimes reſolve to breake through the crowde, and fling her ſelfe at <hi>Fridius</hi> his feet to begge his pardon: But then her ſpirit againe diſdaining ſuch a ſubmiſſion, rather chuſing to caſt her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon amongſt the people, and by her own death incite their revenge, Whilſt theſe confiderations tormented her gentle ſoule, and that his approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching execution ſeemed to exact from her conſent a ſpeedy reſolution, at the further end of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket place appeared a confuſed feare amongſt the common people, which was quickly ſeconded, not onely with cryes of Treaſon, but with the noyſe of many warlike inſtruments, tending to the ſurprize of the Towne, ſo that the ſcaffold that was ordained to be the ſtage where <hi>Caſſa</hi> was to act his laſt part, became ſoon emptied of all thoſe unwelcome aſſiſtances, and he leſt onely to be his own priſoner; an accident certainly that ſufficiently pleaſed him, although his amazed joy had ſcarce beliefe enough to apprehend he was freed, which made him longer continue that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture the executioner had put him in, then his good fortune required at his hands, ſo that he moved not untill one of the Souldiers wiſh't him to pray for the life of <hi>Saxanius</hi> who had delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him from death. By which declaration it
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98927:190"/>was quickly knowne throughout all the Market-place, that <hi>Briſanias</hi> firſt Suitor had both ſaved <hi>Caſſa</hi> from deſtruction, and poſſeſt himſelfe of the City, who hearing of the cruell captivity of his deere Miſtreſſe by the wicked tyranny of <hi>Fridius,</hi> had aſſembled all his friends to her reſcue, and by a neat ſtratagem, had happily brought about the deſigne for her delivery, and her enemies pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: <hi>Fridius</hi> ſufficiently apprehenſive of the guilt of his own Treaſon, ſtaid not to diſpute the right of his cauſe with his victorious rivall, but preſently retired under the ſafe protection of the ſtrong Caſtle, where he ſuppoſed was a Garriſon able to contend, whilſt other ſuccors cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

But <hi>Saxanius</hi> intending neither to be ſlothfull in his love or hate, after he had given ſome orders for the ſurer obedience of the Towne, ſoon placed a formall ſiege before the Fort where his Miſtreſſe was impriſoned, with ſo great a probability of prevailing that within ſome few dayes he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a Meſſage from wicked <hi>Fridius,</hi> that if he did not preſently retire himſelfe and his Troopes from before the Caſtle, he vow'd by all the gods that <hi>Briſania</hi> ſhould act the firſt part in that Tragedy was intended: And for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſurance of his intention, he cauſed the Lady to be brought upon the Leades, where were already prepared the circumſtances of her death.</p>

But then reflecting upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of his deare love, who as he believed, would imagine that he eſteemed much more a little honour then the ſaving of her life, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed his former halfe reſolution, and entered him againe into new and confuſed conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were loſt in his deſperate breaſt with diverſity of paſſions, untill caſting his ſad eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place where <hi>Briſania</hi> was, as a pure ſacrifice to be offered according to his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who ſeemed in his apprehenſion already to accuſe him of unworthy love, that could ſo long diſpute in his minde her preſervation; of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he might ſee one caſt headlong from the top of the Caſtle into the ditch; which too ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded his beliefe that the wicked Tyrant had prevented his judgement, by performing the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98927:191"/>before the returne of his meſſenger: ſo that he remained like one that ſeemed to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a marble Statue, untill a flagge of Truce appeared joyfully upon the Caſtle, as a teſtimony of future friendſhip: however <hi>Saxanius</hi> could not be ſatisfied in the <hi>Omen,</hi> untill a Meſſenger from the Fort aſſured him not onely of the Ladies ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but alſo of the death of <hi>Fridius;</hi> with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that the Souldiers of the Fort, neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure their Princeſſe captivity, nor the Tyrants cruelty, had by force reſcued their Miſtreſſe, and committed a ſupreame Juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his perſon; who now was ſent from <hi>Briſania</hi> to know what conditions the beſiegers expected both for her liberty and the Towne they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conquered. But <hi>Saxanius</hi> would make no Articles at all with his Love, for after he had diſpoſed of his Troopes into ſeverall Quarters, he went to preſent himſelfe a ſlave to the faire Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive he had redeemed, where he intended to chaine his freedome for ever. However <hi>Caſſianus</hi> finding that he was not onely fallen into ſome diſdaine by reaſon of thoſe deſires he expreſt for his own preſervation, as alſo <hi>Saxanius</hi> likely to take poſſeſſion of thoſe favours he might have enjoyed, imagined there was no way to preſerve him ſtill in the good will of his Lady, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his quality, which he ſuppoſed would both advance his eſteeme, and leſſen his rivals credit; and by that meanes become a publicke pretender to <hi>Briſania;</hi> which notwithſtanding produced no other effects then a challenge from <hi>Saxanius,</hi> which <hi>Caſſianus</hi> in honour could not refuſe, after
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98927:191"/>he had given ſufficient teſtimonies of his conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be a Prince and no wandring ſtranger. Yet however the day was appointed for the combate, and every ones expectation attended the finall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the quarrell, <hi>Briſania's</hi> nurſe called <hi>Rhena</hi> promiſed to ſatisfie all parties without danger or bloud, provided her Miſtreſſe would be directed by her Counſells, and become wife to him whom the heavens had ordained to be her husband.</p>
                  <p>This ſtrange intricacy gave curious deſires to multitudes of people to be preſent at the wonder, ſince both the Champions were reſolved not to be foyled in their honour, ſcarce in their loves; Wherefore they came into the Field armed, to ſupply the defect of the old womans performance, according to her bold promiſe: but when they were prepared to have ended the difference by a bloudy encounter. <hi>Rhena</hi> intreated them they would firſt repaire to the great Temple to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the immortall gods, where ſhe ſaid, ſhe might perhaps relate ſuch a ſtory, that would ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie all their deſires. This propoſition from the old woman, although it carried not with it much probability of according the rivalls, their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell being grounded upon a difference that knew not how to admit of any competition, when gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude it ſelfe ſeemed to have no place in <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> diſpoſition, though he enjoyed his life by the fortunate favour of <hi>Saxanius;</hi> yet by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate cryes of the people who began to be leſſe curious and more pitifull, they were perſwaded to follow her directions; and being before the Altar encompaſſed round about by the expecting
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98927:192"/>multitude, <hi>Rhena</hi> after ſhe had called the heavens to witneſſe of the truth of what ſhe intended to utter, delivered this relation, which as ſhe ſaid, ſhe had bound her ſelf by a vow never to declare, untill ſome neceſſity not to be avoyded forced from her the diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>When beautious <hi>Elizana</hi> ſaid ſhe, the vertuous mother of Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> here preſent, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with her deare Husband, to flye from the Countrey of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> by the prevailing power of <hi>Artaxes</hi> generall, in the way being great with child, ſhe was forced to retire to the houſe of my late Lord, Father to <hi>Briſania,</hi> whoſe wife was her neere kinſwoman, and at the ſame time great alſo, where ſhe had not remained many dayes before ſhe was delivered of a faire daughter, as my Lady not long after of another, to the joy of the whole houſe: however, the gods eſteeming my Miſtreſſe too good for this life, took her out of this world before ſhe had finiſhed the moneth of her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, to the unſpeakable ſadneſſe both of her husband, and all her ſervants, leaving no iſſue to inherit her ſingular vertues but a daughter only. <hi>Elizana</hi> alſo being quickly called away by her own troubles, left her little infant unto my edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as my Lord alſo truſted me with his jewel: but accidents and the warres in <hi>Armenia</hi> growing every day more hot then other, for the better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and quiet, I was perſwaded with the two children, to retire to my own houſe, where we remained for ſome yeares, they contented to be each others companion, as I happy to be both their Foſter mother, ſince they increaſed not ſo
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98927:192"/>faſt in dayes and nights as in beauty and goodneſſe; but alaſſe the Fates were envious at our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and tooke one of them out of the world, and with theſe words, the old woman wept with the remembrance of her deare loſſe, untill her many Teares running downe her aged cheekes gave ſome interruption to her diſcourſe: but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her griefe was ſcarce ſeaſonable to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate multitude, ſhe wiped her eyes, and then proceeded: When the violence of the warre ſaid ſhe became ſo qualified, that Parents had ſome lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to enjoy the comfort of their children, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented my Lord with a beautifull daughter; though for the other I had in charge, I deſired his favour to make my excuſe, ſince it was not in my power to prevent the will of the gods, which gave him ſo much ſatisfaction, that he perſwaded <hi>Elizana</hi> by letter to be content that had many more, which continued untill my Lady <hi>Briſania</hi> by his late death as you know became heire to all his poſſeſſions, though interrupted ſome time by wicked <hi>Fridius,</hi> and redeemed by valiant <hi>Saxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> to whom without a great deale of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhe cannot but give her ſelfe, and all that ſhe hath, ſince ſhe hath received it from his hands. At which words <hi>Caſſianus</hi> began to muſter up within his breſt a multitude of paſſions, untill the old woman turning towards him told him, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhe would render him ſatisfied alſo: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after the people were a little quieted in their confuſed murmur, ſhe thus ended her ſtory: But now ſaid ſhe to unriddle this myſtery, and fully to performe my promiſe, I muſt let know, that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98927:193"/>
                     <hi>Briſania</hi> wat not child to your late deceaſed Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, but daughter to worthy <hi>Elizana;</hi> I onely uſing that fallacy upon the death of the other, becauſe I feared the loſſe to my Lord would have proved a vexation intollerable, ſince he wanted children to inherit his fortune and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; and for <hi>Elizana,</hi> I ſuppoſed the croſſe would not appeare ſo great, in reſpect of the bountifulneſſe of the iſſue which the gods had beſtowed upon her; however I made a private vow to my ſelfe as I ſaid, never to diſcover this myſtery, untill ſome preſſing occaſion forced from me the declaration, aſwell to retaine <hi>Briſania</hi> in her ſuppoſed Fathers poſſeſſions, as to take from their Parents all jealouſie of my fraude. But ſince the heaven by the power and right of conqueſt, have now eſtabliſh't my Lord <hi>Saxanius</hi> in that government which <hi>Briſania</hi> did intend innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to uſurpe, and that his noble prententions to her love deſerve her beſt entertainment, as if the Gods intended a perpetuall unity in their hearts againſt all obſtacles, I hope it will be the opinion of all here preſent, that the marriage between them be ſolemnized inſtantly in the Temple; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that I cannot doubt Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> will forbid the conjunction, ſince nature denies him the capacity of ſuch a happineſſe. This declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was quickly warranted by the deſires of all the people with loude acclamations, ſo that <hi>Briſania</hi> turning about to <hi>Saxanius</hi> with a bluſh that more enflamed his joy, after a little pawſe ſaluted him with this language: My Lord ſaid ſhe, for ſo it ſhould ſeeme the deſtinies have deſigned you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98927:193"/>all difficulties, though whether I ſhall be now eſteemed worthy in your vertuous thoughts to give you that Title may be ſome queſtion, ſince your noble addreſſes formerly received not thoſe ready entertainements they merited: however, I ſhall endeavour to perſwade you to believe that the heavens have had a ſecret influence whereby the better to unite our ſelves, ſince my prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affection to my Brother upon ſmall grounds endeavoured ſomething to obſcure your perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in my apprehenſion, which now appeare to my knowledge in a moſt full and affectionate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that abſolutely delights all my ſenſes. And with that, as if ſhe had been too liberall in her language, like a Roſe over-preſt with the nights dew, by little and little caſt downe her lovely lookes upon the ground. <hi>Saxanius</hi> inſtead of delivering his judgement concerning <hi>Briſania's</hi> plea, put in execution his intended decree by a gentle kiſſe upon her faire lips, which gave the people ſufficient intelligence of his thoughts, ſo that the marriage became preſently ſolemnized, to the content of all the ſtanders by, but more ſpecially to themſelves, whoſe happineſſe could not fully be apprehended but in the fruition one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And this Madam, I ſay, is the delightfull, though intricate ſtory of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> adventures, ſince his departure out of <hi>Lydia,</hi> which he was pleaſed to ſignifie in waiting under his own hand; however to none but to his faithfull friend and chiefeſt counſellour <hi>Dimogoras.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now that I have entertained your eares with theſe ſtrange though pleaſant paſſages; as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98927:194"/>I may ſay, ſeemingly rather miracles, then acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, I ſhall come neerer a great deale to your concernments: This intelligence of the ſafety of the Prince, you muſt know, enflamed the thoughts of <hi>Dimogoras;</hi> whereupon he began to conſider if a marriage could be compaſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cloria</hi> the Kings daughter and <hi>Caſſtanus,</hi> it would undoubtedly, not onely ſtrengthen his own greatneſſe, but exceedingly fortifie all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of contentions of the Senate, with <hi>Euarchus</hi> the King, ſince by this means his daughter ſhould not be matched to any forrain Prince, that might give her father aſſiſtance; but rather by degrees would be wrought to be an enemy to his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and deſires.</p>
                  <p>With theſe conſiderations he went preſently to the Senate, whereby to make them acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the intelligence he had received. To this purpoſe, being ſat in the Councell, he utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this kind of ſpeech, with as much eloquence as his naturall roughneſſe, and want of education could deliver.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, ſaid he, as it is moſt evident, the gods have hitherunto proſpered our attempts in a moſt admirable manner, to the wonder of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> ſo of the other ſide may we againe behold, a kind of miraculous influence depending upon thoſe accidents, ſignified unto you by Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> Letters: Theſe things being conſidered, I ſee no reaſon, nay I may boldly affirme there is a great deale of piety in the reſolution, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſervice of the gods, as alſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the eſtabliſhing of our own affaires, to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98927:194"/>endeavour all waies poſſible, to unite the perſons and affections, of <hi>Cloria</hi> the Kings daughter, and <hi>Caſſianus</hi> the advent'rous Prince, in ſuch indiſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable ties of love and marriage, that may not onely render them happy themſelves, but ſecure us from all feare of a forraigne conjunction, that undoubtedly would diſorder (if not deſtroy) that work we have already wiſely begun, and hope ſhall fortunately end in this Kingdome. For my part, I muſt confeſſe, I doe almoſt trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yet, when I conſider in how great a hazzard our affaires ſtood, before your Admirall ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed the Princeſs at <hi>Pergame;</hi> for that the alliance intended between herſelfe and <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> could not have been other than ominous; when as of the other ſide, we are moſt aſſured, to ſinde <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> upon all occaſions, not onely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may be a little ſtartled with the doubts, that <hi>Cloria</hi> will ſcarce be brought to think of ſuch Nuptials; but truly theſe are meely frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſiderations, in compariſon of benefits of States, and Kingdoms; wherefore I ſay, If ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perſwaded to yield her conſent, by the influence of his Courtſhip, ſhe muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by your power and authority. So that my opinion is, that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> be preſently ſent for, not onely to put in execution, with all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, what we ſhall determine for our own happineſſe, and the Kingdomes welfare; but alſo to be honoured and maintained by our loves and affections, according to our former reſolution and promiſes.

                  <p>This oration being delivered with more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence then rhetorick, he ſat down in his place expecting the iſſue: which produced not onely ſeverall diſcourſes, but much ſeeming conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard of divers and ſundry intereſts: yet <hi>Dimogoras,</hi> with others of the ſame faction, ſo farre prevailed at laſt, that it was abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſhould with all expedition be ſent for, with an aſſurance of the intended match between him and the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When <hi>Creſes</hi> had made an end of thus much of his diſcourſe, he refted ſilent, as it were expecting ſome kind of reply from <hi>Roxana:</hi> but finding the old woman at leaſtwiſe troubled, if not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing confounded at the relation, he began anew with her in this manner:</p>
                  <p>Truly, ſaid he, it were a kind of diſſervice, onely to mention dangers to torment your appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; and not at the ſame time to-propund remedies that might probably cure the diſeaſe; which would turn all my profeſſed curteſies into nothing but cauſes of jealouſie and ſuſpition: Wherefore Madam, as the time that will be given, for the ſolicitations of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> cannot be long;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98927:195"/>his arrivall being expected every houre, many weeks being paſt ſince he was ſent for to <hi>Sardis:</hi> ſo muſt you ſpeedily reſolve upon the prevention, unleſſe you are willing to comply with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates intentions. In ſhort, be your thoughts and reſolutions what they will, I make bold to aſſure you, if you dare but give ſufficient confidence to my promiſes; or doubt not my capacity to perform them, to deliver the Pinceſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> and your ſelfe free from your preſent impriſonment; which being effected, you may retire under the protection of <hi>Euarchus</hi> the King at <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> yet I muſt leave the particulars to further diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when I may be aſſured of your reſolutions: but if neither my deſigne, or faith pleaſe you; for that perchance I ſeem to be at preſent, what notwithſtanding I intend not to be many daies, I muſt conjure you not to diſcover theſe motions to any, but to your Lady; which is a juſtice I hope your honour and goodneſſe cannot deny me.</p>
                  <p>It was a queſtion whether this ſtory and offer did more amaze or content <hi>Roxana,</hi> ſince as ſhe did not expect the one, ſo ſhe could not hope for the other: notwithſtanding with few circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and a great deale of thanks, ſhe entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his motion, confirmed with her ſtrong pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations of all their gratitudes to that ſervice he ſhould perform; which was enough to part them at preſent, by reaſon of the paſſion the old woman had to inform the Princeſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana,</hi> although ſhe acquainted her Miſtreſſe with theſe pleaſing propoſitions, (who apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

To this purpoſe, after ſome few daies ſhe became informed, that he was a young Nobleman of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> called <hi>Creſes,</hi> imployed by the Senate in the government of the Countrey about the Caſtle, which made her alſo obſerve his actions, whereby ſhe might learn, whether it were a new inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted duty that taught him better obedience to the Kings ſervice then formerly; or whether ſome diſcontent of his other Lords proceedings at <hi>Sardis,</hi> in regard of his own perſon, cauſed him revengefully to put off his truſt. But as within the compaſſe of ſome weeks ſhe was ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it was neither of theſe reaſons that gave him an appetite to leave his command, and begin a new loyalty to his King; ſo of the other ſide ſhe became aſſured in her opinion, that his ſecret love to the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> was the principall cauſe that made him offer ſo acceptable a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to the hazzard of his own life; and with this knowledge fell into many conſiderations with her Miſtreſſe, whether it were better with ſecurity of their perſons, ſtill to remaine in the Caſtle, where they were under the juriſdiction of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and to expect the vexations of <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> importunity upon his arrivall, as <hi>Creſes</hi> had informed them, or hazard themſelves under the protection of the new lover, whoſe diſpoſition and intention they were not acquainted withall; nevertheleſſe, after long debate they fell upon the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98927:196"/>latter, which was rather abſolutely to truſt his paſſion, then expect the Senates goodneſſe; And to that purpoſe <hi>Roxana</hi> told <hi>Creſes</hi> in the Princeſſes name, that ſhe was reſolved wholly not onely to relye upon his fidelity, but to be directed in her journey to her Father by his care; which gave <hi>Creſes</hi> a world of content, not alone that he was thought worthy of ſo great a conſidence, but by this meanes he ſhould free his apprehenſion from the danger of <hi>Gaſſianus</hi> courſhip; ſo that within a weekes ſpace he provided all things neceſſary for their eſcape: whilſt in the meane time <hi>Cloria</hi> pretended a ſickneſſe that cauſed her to keep her chamber, whereby no ſuſpition of her flight, might remaine for ſome dayes after her depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as <hi>Creſes</hi> did of important buſineſſe, which called him to a neceſſary attendance at <hi>Sardis:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the deſigned night came that they were to begin their journey which was expected with ſome impatience, the Princeſſe <hi>Roxana,</hi> and their intruſted dwarfe, the only attendants they would uſe for feare of diſcovery, repaired to a place at the foote of the Caſtle hill, where one Sentinell being more curious then the reſt, would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted their paſſage, but their ready know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the word, gave him a quicke diſcharge, and ſo conſequently ſet them free to take their Horſes, that were provided not farre off by <hi>Creſes</hi> care, who was there alſo attending himſelfe to mount the Princeſſe and the other company: But ſcarce had the cheerfull morning appeared in the Eaſt, after a redious nights travell in rough and unbeaten wayes, when they arrived at an even
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98927:197"/>plaine, that not onely afforded them ſome conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to ſweeten their paſt inconvenience, but gave opportunity to <hi>Creſes,</hi> reflecting upon his owne truſt, and enflamed by his ſecret love to uſe this language to the Princeſſe.</p>
                  <p>Madam, ſaid he, as I envy not the Gods happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the converſation I have power to enjoy, ſo the truſt that is committed to my care, deſerves a diligence beyond expreſſion, wherein if I had a thouſand lives they were all too few to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in ſuch a ſervice; yet give me leave to ſay without profanation of your ſacred ſelfe, that love is the onely price that ought to purchaſe your perſon by an honourable pitty, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be wanting where there are ſo many other admirable perfections; for ſince none can merit your vertues, your goodneſſe will appeare in the greateſt luſtre, when it ſhall be ſeene you chuſe, becauſe you intend abſolutely to oblige, like the heavens that take moſt pleaſure in forgiving high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt offences. It may perhaps be eſteemed by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant apprehenſions, a kinde of an equality in worth, when Titles are united, but you know that darke foyles are uſed to illuſtrate bright Diamonds, wherefore let not honours be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of your lookes; which however, although they cannot outſhine yours, yet certainly the clearneſſe of your beauty will beſt appeare when others are removed, like the faire Moone when the Sunne is moſt obſcured that offends by his too much violence; Flowers ſeeme more delighfull in innocent fields, then in ſtately Gardens; and chriſtall ſtreames are plentifuller repleniſhed with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98927:197"/>variety of watry inhabitants, when the green meadowes give them boundes, rather then where Marble ſtructures enrich their aboade; then kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her hand with a paſſionate earneſtneſſe, he bathed her white glove with a few of his owne Teares, that quickly gave <hi>Cloria</hi> Items of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; but ſhe would take no notice of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe being unwilling to diſquiet her protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſince ſhe could not condiſcend to his deſire, ſo that ſhe was conſtrain'd prettily to divert the occaſion by calling her Governeſſe to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, pretending that elſe her rigid gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might chide them both for their diſ-reſpect; when <hi>Roxana</hi> was arrived at a neerer diſtance, the Princeſſe perceiving her to be much troubled, if not altogether tired with the paſt nights travell, by her often removing her ſelfe upon her Saddle, not being accuſtomed to many ſuch exerciſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had bid her be of good cheere, began to queſtion with her concerning the practice and imployment of her youth; and whether or no women in thoſe dayes did uſe to ride a hunting according to the faſhions now of <hi>Lydia?</hi> faith no Madam ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> in thoſe times maides were more modeſtly bred then to exerciſe ſuch hoyting recreations; for if their mothers ſuffered them to walke a turne or two in the garden, after they had performed a good dayes worke upon their Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers, and of holy dayes to goe eate a meſſe of Creame in ſome honeſt neighbours houſe, it was eſteemed a large liberty; beſides there was a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proviſion by their parents, that no men of any ſon ſhould accompany them; although they were
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98927:198"/>ſuch as pretended to be Suitors, and the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of marriage already agreed upon; but now by my truly there is nothing but private court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and publicke love with continuall diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizements, from one pleaſure to another; ſo that young girles endeavour nothing more, then to become bold and ſcandalous: nay I can aſſure you Princeſſe ſaid ſhe, a Maide durſt not ſo much as ſmile before her Father and Mother, ſcarce looking upon their woers before they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; in which baſhfull poſture on the night of their Nuptials, they entertained their husbands with teares onely.</p>
                  <p>This diſcourſe or rather paſſion of the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, proceeding as 'twas ſuppoſed from the hard going of her horſe, gave <hi>Cloria</hi> occaſion to tell her in a gentle ſmile, that the reaſon why they did not practice ſuch paſtimes, was becauſe they wanted good horſes for the ſport, and Coaches at ſhe had heard were not then in uſe: good hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> I cannot tell what you call good, but for my part I was never worſe carried then at the preſent; at which the Princeſſe began to laugh out-right, ſince ſhe had ſo directly hit upon the diſeaſe of her Governeſſe. However <hi>Creſes</hi> that he might prevent all quarrells told her, that ſince ſhe found hers not eaſie, ſhe ſhould ride on his, which perhaps would better pleaſe her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he proteſted he had no deſigne but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate her before himſelfe; whereupon ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her downe from her ſaddle, in a quarter of an houres time made the exchange, though the labour ſeemed fruitleſſe; for the old woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <p>Many dayes they had not travelled in this large Forreſt, to ſeeke out obſcure wayes to prevent ſurprize, ſince they ſuppoſed they ſhould haſtily be purſued if not encountered by ſome of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates Forces, lying in a manner every night, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98927:199"/>in a poor Cottage, or in the open aire, which the couragious Princeſſe underwent with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable fortitude, hoping her reward at laſt ſhould be not onely to ſee her deare Father, but to heare ſome newes of her love <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> for whoſe ſake her thoughts were chiefly tormented; before they arrived at a ſmall playn encompaſſed with wood, which the more flouriſhed, becauſe <hi>Phoebus</hi> had not ſo abſolute a dominion in that place as elſewhere. At the farther end of the Plaine upon the riſing of a little hill, that directed its view towards the Eaſt, they might behold a houſe; though not of any appearing capacity, to containe many perſons: but long they had not contemplated the commodity of their ſuppoſed nights lodging, ere they ſpyed an old Father with his booke in his hand, ſitting under a Tree, which gave occaſion to <hi>Creſes,</hi> whilſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and <hi>Roxana</hi> were content to take ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in that ſolitude, to preſent himſelfe to the aged man, aſwell to be informed who he was, as alſo to receive ſome benefit by his aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore after they had civilly ſaluted one another, and that <hi>Creſes</hi> had told him he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted certaine diſtreſſed Ladies towards <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia,</hi> where their friends remained in the Kings warres, and alſo that they wanted for the preſent accommodation of lodging for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching night, the old man ſeemed not onely willing to pleaſure him in any thing, but of the ſudden burſt forth into abundance of Teares and complaints, as it ſhould ſeem at the remembrance of <hi>Euarchus</hi> and his fortunes, which made <hi>Creſes</hi>

                  <p>Sir ſaid he, ſince you will needs be acquainted with my fortunes, you muſt know in my youth I was bred by the carefull induſtry of my parents a ſcholler, which profeſſion brought me firſt in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with my Prince <hi>Euarchus</hi> Father, who was himſelfe not onely learned, but exceedingly lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the converſation of thoſe that were poſſeſſed with ſuch qualities, which at the firſt Joyned with the ambition of my owne nature, made me a Courtier, and that vocation as I thought, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted from me a diligence to preferment, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, honours were but moderately conferred upon me, during the life of the old King; though after his death his ſonne <hi>Euarchus,</hi> whether miſtaking my ability or being in love with my fidelity, ſhowred downe ſo many favours upon me, that I not onely in a ſhort time, became chiefe <hi>Flamin</hi> of all <hi>Lydia,</hi> but in a manner governed the whole State under the King, which heaped on me ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient envy; and the rather ſince I conferred many offices poſſeſſed formerly by the Nobility upon thoſe of my owne profeſſion, whereby the better to ſtrengthen my party, and dignifie my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: In this poſture I remained untill the great Senate that now rules in <hi>Lydia</hi> chaced me from
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98927:200"/>Court and Common-weale, which made me ſeek out this private habitation, untill the fate of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi> government ſhall be ſo determined that I may againe returne to his ſervice, or reſolve to end my life in this ſolitude; and with that wept, which for ſome time continued them both in a penſive ſilence, untill <hi>Creſes</hi> importuned the aged father to put off his ſorrow; or at leaſtwiſe ſuffer him to be a ſharer with him in his griefe, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him know more particularly the cauſes: this gave occaſion to the old man to tell him that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Souldiers were newly arrived in the Forreſt to ſhelter themſelves by the protection of the woods, from the rage of their perſecutors, who followed them after a Battell that was lately fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Thyaſmus</hi> and the Senates Forces, where both he and almoſt his whole Army being ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by an Ambuſcado of the enemy, had loſt the day to the abſolute deſtruction of the Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and an utter undoing as 'twas believed of all his friends, ſince <hi>Euarchus</hi> expects every houre in perſon to be beſieged in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This unexpected newes did more then trouble <hi>Creſes,</hi> not onely becauſe it did in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his owne hopes that ſeemed to depend upon the ſucceſſe of the journey he had in hand, which was to preſent the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> an acceptable offering to her Father, but in denying them all meanes to avoid a dangerous conſequence, ſince they neither could advance towards their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, for doubt of interruption in the paſſage by ſcattering Troopes of the Senates garriſons, nor durſt retire back againe to the Caſtle for feare
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98927:201"/>of being cruelly puniſhed for the eſcape: ſo that he was forced to make the old father acquainted with the perſonall preſence of the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> and the rather ſince he could no way intruſt his fidelity, but of the contrary by that knowledge procure a reception of her in his houſe untill his owne returne from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> whither he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ſecretly to go, that he might the better be informed of the Kings condition, and by that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection more conveniently ſecure the Princeſſe <hi>Gloria</hi> either by flight into ſome forraigne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or deliver her perſon into the protection of her owne Father as he had promiſed: yet he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured the <hi>Flamine,</hi> after he had layed open unto him his thoughts, intentions, and deſires, not to diſcover the leaſt ſyllable of theſe diſaſterous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to the Princeſſe, for feare of diſquieting her gentle boſome with misfortunes, no care of hers could remedy; though he determined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her to be contented to diſpence with his owne abſence for ſome time, to performe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded neceſſary ſervice for her ſafety. When they had ſufficiently digeſted theſe reſolutions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements, they both roſe from their ſeats to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to <hi>Cloria;</hi> the Princeſſe at their approach entertained the <hi>Flamine,</hi> with the ſame affection ſhe conceived to be due to one, that had beene formerly honoured by her Fathers favours; whilſt he with Teares in his eyes, preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her and the reſt of the company to his ſmall habitation; excuſing notwithſtanding in a courtly phraſe, the pooreneſſe of the welcome ſhe was to expect: but long ſhe had not enjoyed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98927:201"/>the pleaſing ſecurity of that retirement, before ſhe was overtaken with a moſt horrid and inſolent treaſon in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>The Souldiers that cowardly were fled from the battell, as the <hi>Flamine</hi> had related to <hi>Creſes,</hi> and were retired within the Fortifications of thoſe woods, for their better ſecurity againſt their purſuers, underſtanding by ſome intelligence that the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> was lodged privately within the old Fathers houſe, began to conſider, that if they returned her back again to the Senate at <hi>Sardis,</hi> from whence they underſtood ſhe was eſcaped, it would prove ſo acceptable, that they ſhould not onely thereby purchaſe all their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, but probably many of the chiefe actors might receive conſiderable rewards. This opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they no ſooner entertained in their wicked and diſloyall breaſts, but the execution followed with ſo much violence, that they not onely ſeized <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Roxana,</hi> but alſo carried with them the old <hi>Flamine,</hi> as a full period to their ſupream villany, notwithſtanding all the perſwaſions could be uſed towards them; but the gods ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the traytors, though the Senate made uſe of the treaſon, all they could procure for this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice, was to have their lives ſaved, upon condition, they ſhould within ten daies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Kingdome; or elſe, to ſuffer preſent death whereſoever they could be found after the limited time, which cauſed them to curſe the very day of their births.</p>
                  <p>However this juſt ſentence was a deſerving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for their offences, yet poore <hi>Cloria</hi> enjoyed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98927:202"/>no comfort in her captivity, but rather her croſſes were augmented by the arrivall of <hi>Caſſianus:</hi> one day when ſhe was retired into the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of her lodgings, with an intention to contribute a large proportion to her ſorrows, eſteeming it the beſt converſation ſhe could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe in theſe ſad times, ſhe was of a ſudden ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Prince, who conceived his power gave him a ſufficient warrant for any intruſion; where, after he had continued his courtſhip with a few complements, he ſtrived to proteſt his affection, with all the reaſons that the ſame religion, neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of kindred, and his vow'd ſervice to her father could pretend unto; which pluckt from the Princeſſe this ſharp and ſudden reply, contrary to her nature.</p>
                  <p>Cozen, ſaid ſhe, although your own thoughts can beſt witneſſe the Religion you hold, yet give me leave to tell you, that my knowledge receives no ſatisfaction by your profeſſion, ſince you vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſeem to runne along with that current, that ſeeks by all means poſſible to deſtroy the <hi>Lydian</hi> rights, in taking away the <hi>Flamins</hi> out of the Temples, the onely pretended occaſion now of theſe warrs between my father and his Senate, in which cuſtomes I have been brought up from my cradle.

                  <p>Worthy Couſin ſaid ſhe, (for ſo I will now call you, ſince I finde your words reall, and your love noble) if the Gods did give me the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98927:205"/>of being your wife, I ſhould a great deale ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, declare my ſelfe perſwaded to the choyce by your owne vertues, then by the Senates wiſedome, ſince the intereſt of a kingdome is not to be put in the ballance with the unity of affection; the one proceeding onely from forced reaſons, that laſt no longer then the motives have power by the operation of private ends, when the other ariſing from the ſecret influence of the heavens, engraves a perpetuall affection in the heart, not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by humane Tyranny. Wherefore I ſay, intereſts of Crownes cannot contribute any thing to the felicity of Nuptialls, however ſometimes they pretend falſe ſhewes to cover hidden diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and ſo by that meanes couzens the world into a beliefe of what the married couple never enjoy, of the contrary enduring millions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed torments, that are increaſed in violence when they burſt forth like impriſoned flames, which by accidents procure their owne liberty: Therefore I ſay, nay I will boldly profeſſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing the puniſhment of a thouſand deaths, before I be ever compelled to marry by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of earthly reſpects, much leſſe be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take any for my husband, that hath not really perſwaded my judgement, or abſolutely wrought upon my fancy; let it ſuffice your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections carry with them more powerfullneſſe in my conſideration, then the Senates deſires doe waight in my underſtanding, though I ſhould be ſorry to chuſe raſhly, or to be guided wholly by mine owne opinions; which is enough to let you ſee my unconquered, and I
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98927:205"/>hope pure love cannot be conſtrained, although my deare life pay the ranſome of my ſeeming wilfulneſſe: for though Tyranny may ſhut up my weake body within ſtrong Walles, untill the juſt gods puniſh the wickedneſſe, yet my reſolved ſoul will be free to make election of death, or life, as the occaſion ſhall be preſented; ſo that as your actions have changed already my beliefe of your intentions; doe not againe change your actions, that I become of an other minde, wherein you will but loſe honour inſtead of gaining love; and that loſſe perhaps may make you uncapable of all other fortunes; it is enough, I valew your bloud, I eſteem your perſon, and love your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; however I cannot be yours in poſſeſſion as long as <hi>Narciſſus</hi> lives; and with thoſe words wept againe, as at her former apprehenſions of his ſafety, which continued her in a ſilence, untill <hi>Caſſianus</hi> reply gave her thoughts new matter to work upon:</p>
                  <p>Madam ſaid he, as I cannot but be perſwaded, though unwillingly by your powerfull and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rhetoricke, yet give me leave to tell you, that I underſtand not your concluſion, ſince you have beene pleaſed to ſay in your diſcourſe, that as long as <hi>Narciſſus</hi> lives you cannot be mine; a chovce I muſt confeſſe, that the gods have never to this houſe revealed unto me, ſince at my lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of <hi>Lydia,</hi> a match of a farre greater dignity in Titles, ſeemed to be the obſtacle that deſtroyed my hopes, and ſo conſequently all motions I could make of my ſecret love: but however, if my ears have not much deceived my knowledge, I have
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98927:206"/>heard it generally reported, that ſome accident many moneths ſince hath deprived <hi>Narciſſus</hi> not onely of the ſhare you pretend he hath in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but alſo of all the claime he can expect in this world. If it have ſaid <hi>Clorias</hi> your pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the neerer; and with that fell a weeping again ſo bitterly that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> could not chuſe but accompany her in her griefe; but after ſome time that his thoughts had liberty to enter into conſideration both of the Princeſſes words and of his owne concernment, ſcarce yet believing her relation, he told her, that he had no reaſon to claime the intereſt of another; yet if <hi>Narciſſus</hi> were dead, he hoped his love and ſervice ſhould expect the next place in her affection: and with that parted from her, with an intention to make a more particular enquiry, into the truth of the intelligence, which afforded the Princeſſe a kinde of a calme for the preſent, that contented her thoughts.</p>
                  <p>And this calm having made her diſcontents ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to erable, ſhe was perſwaded one afternoon by her Governeſs, to take ſome little delight or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, in a green Meadow within the limits of her impriſonment, that uſually was not frequented by ſtrangers, where a River in the midſt divided the field by a ſeeming equall arbitration; which afforded a kind of a ſad entertainment to the Princeſſe, whilſt <hi>Roxana</hi> was perſwaded alſo by her many ſolicitous thoughts, to ſearch out ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary walkes in the neighbouring woods, for the exerciſe of her contemplation: To this purpoſe <hi>Cloria</hi> ſitting down by the Brook ſide, ſupporting
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98927:206"/>in the interim her faire cheeks by her white hand, whilſt her knee underpropped both, as a rich foundation that nature had created, for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a moſt noble building, her fancy was carried as it were with a ſtedfaſt melancholly to behold the running ſtreame, that repreſented to her troubled imagination, her own inconſtant fate, that had formerly afforded her ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of happineſſe, in the converſation of her deare <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> whom now ſhe was not ſure ever to enjoy againe, which by a quick courſe ſeemed to haſten to the Sea to be drowned in that vaſt confuſion, as her paſt delight was buried in her Fathers misfortunes and her own. And as ſhe was ſending alſo her teares along with the courſe of the River into the man Ocean, to be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the multitude of thoſe rude waters, of a ſudden ſhe ſaw a Pilgrim to travers the Meadow, as if his ignorance in thoſe parts had rendred him altogether unskilfull in the wayes: But the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe being yet fuller of charity then ſorrow, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced for the preſent with her griefe, to give him ſome inſtruction; and to that purpoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to her, began to queſtion with him about his name and buſineſſe: The Pilgrim in a kind of amazed reply told her, that as his name ſcarce deſerved any remembrance amongſt thoſe that enjoyed happy conditions, by reaſon of his many misfortunes, ſo for his buſineſſe, he ſhould be loath to impart it to any, before it did reach the eares of the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> to whom it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, whoſe aboad as he was informed was not farre off that place.

The Princeſſe quickly commanded him to riſe, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him, that as the limitation of thoſe fields did not belong wholly to her juriſdiction, ſhe being her ſelfe a priſoner alſo under authority, ſo if ſhe were an abſolute commandreſſe (as he did imagine) ſhe was ſo well acquainted with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance due to his ſacred habit, that his free abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution would ſoone have been procured at her hands.

Wherefore, after ſome few circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, finding no importunity of hers was able to remove him from his ſetled humility, ſhe told him ſhe was the Lady to whom the intention of his travels was directed. When the Pilgrim had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98927:207"/>received this information, he beſeeched her a new to pardon his rude errour, ſince as he ſaid, being lately come out of <hi>Syria,</hi> he could not be enformed of the dignity of her perſon, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any attendants about her to inſtruct his knowledge; and then wept againe as if his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had been nothing elſe, but meer expreſſions of ſorrow; untill at laſt having wiped his eyes with a Handkerchiefe hanging at his girdle, he entertained the Princeſſe with this language:</p>

The chiefe commander of that Iſland for the preſent is a great noble man of <hi>Lydia,</hi> who however he keeps a certaine correſpondency with the Senate for his own more convenient ſecurity, yet in his heart he is an entire ſervant to the King your Father, which not onely made me think my welcome ſo much the better in his Country; but his wife being my moſt neare kinſwoman, I was perſwaded to make my aboad for ſome few dayes in that place, whilſt in the interim we ſent out many ſmall veſſels, to enquire after your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but however I could have been very well content, to have remained there longer, in regard of the vertuous and noble entertainment both of the Lord and Lady, yet upon the meſſengers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne finding no advertizement could be given concerning your particular, with a certain kinde of melancholly rage I retired into my chamber, where I continued notwithſtanding any perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary, untill another ſhip was fitted for our transportation, in regard ours was held forthe preſent altogether uncapable of another voyage, without a great deale of mending and reparation: within two or three dayes I took my leave of my kinſwoman, and her Lord; though the gods knew in a very blunt manner, (my
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98927:210"/>thoughts being over burthened for complements) and preſently directed my courſe to the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> where I hoped you were; or at leaſtwiſe by my comming thither would be arrived; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I could not in my fearfull appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion but doubt the worſt, notwithſtanding thoſe in the ſhip, endeavoured by many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, to confirme me in a certain belief of your ſafety, which made the journey ſomething leſſe tedious and diſtaſtfull: I conjured the whole company entirely to conceale my name, from any perſon whatſoever untill you were found: when we landed at <hi>Salamine</hi> I underſtood the Queene your mother and my father were both lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from thence to <hi>Paphos,</hi> where again ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enquiring after you, and not hearing any news whatſoever either of your aboad or ſafety, after I had ſpent ſome time in tearing my haire, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing other fruitleſſe complaints, I reſolved in a diſguiſe to ſeek you out in the country of <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylia;</hi> whither very probably I conceited the winds and the ſtorm might have driven your ſhip, and by that meanes have committed your perſon to a new impriſonment, ſince that Territory is known to belong unto the King of <hi>Egypt:</hi> To this purpoſe having changed my habit (being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompanied by a few of my attendants I could beſt truſt) we put <hi>Egyptian</hi> colours upon the top of our veſſel, as if we had onely belonged to the principality of <hi>Pamphylia:</hi> thus we ſalled with all poſſible ſpeed towards the confines of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> in regard we underſtand by certaine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Syria</hi> remaining in <hi>Salamine,</hi> no newes

This language meeting my diſcontents and deſpaire, cauſed me to make a greater reſiſtance, then was either convenient or neceſſary for our welfare, untill at laſt being wounded in many parss of my body, and not a few of the company ſlain or hurt, our ſhip was not onely ſeiſed upon, but my ſelfe carried to the Caſtle of the Town, where an Officer belonging to <hi>Philos</hi> commanded me to cuſtody, for that <hi>Philos</hi> was for the preſent gone to <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> within three daies <hi>Philos</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from Court, and not long after comming into my chamber, he quickly knew who I was: ſo beſtowing upon me ſome few complements (I deſiring him in the interim to conceale my name and qualisy) he preſently gave order, for my reſpectfull attendance and neceſſary cure: alſo he appointed me to be removed to the beſt lodgings in his Caſtle, with a promiſe abſolutely not to diſcover my perſon to any, but his own ſiſter <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> who, as he ſaid to his knowledge, would contribute her beſt aſſiſtance to my reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: in this condition (though extreamly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

After I had not only viewed but commended the artificiall hand, that had ſo lively deſcribed the delightfull ſtory, <hi>Artemeſia</hi> made me this reply; that it was no wonder if humane creatures were given ſo much to love, when the very gods themſelves were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with thoſe paſſions. Truly Madam ſaid I, although I cannot but allow of the paſſion, when it is ordained to produce onely noble effects, yet certainly the gods could never be ſubject to thoſe imperfections, when for the moſt part their flames were unlawfull, as either preventing of other mens loves, or deſtroying the chaſtity of virgines, as the Poets mention: for my part ſaid ſhe, I am of opinion, although moſt of their actions deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by the wandring fancies of Poets, were but meer fictions, yet it cannot be but the ſtories of <hi>Perſeus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> both ſons to <hi>Iupiter</hi> were true, and conſequently doe ſhew to our example, the lawfulneſſe of the paſſion, when ſuch <hi>Heros</hi> were produced: the one of a married wife, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a maid, to free the world from oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and injury, ſince they appeared buſied in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imployment; who for their excellent quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and juſtice, have been ſince eſteemed gods. This diſcourſe I muſt confeſſe comming from a virgin, did ſomething amaze me, yet we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued our diſputation untill the time of the day, and <hi>Philos</hi> comming into the room, prevented any further contention, in a ſubject I as much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in as her ſelfe. At which expreſſion the ſweet Princeſſe ſmiled, as if ſome cauſe had been
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98927:213"/>given her of jealouſie, however ſhe told him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his ſtory began to be ſuſpitious, yet ſhe had ſo much juſtice in her reſolution, as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the end of his diſcourſe, hoping that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation at laſt would cleere all difficulties: but by my honeſty Madam ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> you will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance be deceived in your confidence, when you may be ſure he will never accuſe himſelfe what fault ſoever he hath committed privately; which words proceeded ſo ſharply from the old womans delivery, that it might be eaſily conjectured, that in her youth ſhe had been ſometimes couzened in her love; or at leaſtwiſe was of that opinion: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> bid <hi>Narciſſus</hi> go on, proteſting ſhe would not doe that wrong to her own inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and noble thoughts, as to ſuſpect him whom ſhe had in her judgment eſteemed worthy of her affections: At which declaration the poore Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim ſeemed to be tranſported with a new joy; and after he had given her humble thankes for the confidence ſhe had of his vertues, that became en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by that opinion, he took her white hand againe, upon which he imprinted a multitude of vowes able to drive jealouſie out of the world, and then proceeded in this manner.</p>
                  <p>But this interruption as I ſaid, not onely put off the exerciſing of my wit, and perhaps <hi>Arteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia's</hi> intention, but alſo carried us all to ſupper, where many lookes of the young Lady to invite my eyes to the like encounter, gave my thoughts more then enough ſuſpition, and ſo conſequently my minde a great deale of trouble all the night following; untill the morning brought into my

Firſt the dangerous conſequence of being in the cuſtody of <hi>Artemeſia's</hi> brother, who had the commodity as well to deſtroy as to ſpeak the word; and next the rage of the whole family if they ſhould conceive themſelves diſhonoured by the refuſall. Yet deare <hi>Cloria</hi> ſaid he, my not to be conquered loyalty to you, was ſufficient to reſiſt, though not to prevent all difficulties. At which expreſſion, the Princeſſe only with another pretty ſmile, bid him go on in his ſtory; but the firſt ſaid he, moſt troubled my thoughts, ſince <hi>Philos</hi> love to his ſiſter as I believed, would eaſily be perſwaded by my death to make a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between our affections, when he ſhould finde my conſtancy could not be removed by his milder art, rather then hazard <hi>Artemoſia's</hi> honour; but for the ſecond, although I ſuppoſed the whole family would hold it for a ſupreame indignity, to have their kinſ-woman refuſed by my neglect, yet the revenge could not well be executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the diſcovery of the Ladies paſſion: but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved as my beſt defence, neither to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the old womans diſcourſe, nor of her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes courtſhip, until I were yet preſt by ſome new overture, not to be waved without a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory reply, and then to ſhew my courage in our loves; ſince the Ladies paſſions, I ſuppoſed would not break out to any dangerous violence,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:98927:214"/>untill ſhe became abſolutely deſperate in her hopes. After I had dreſt my ſelfe, and was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining my thoughts in a retiring place belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to my lodging, I became ſuddenly invited by a meſſenger ſent by <hi>Philos,</hi> to accompany him to a certaine place belonging to his Uncle <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> not above foure houres voyage in a Coach; where the great favourite had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed abundance of wealth, with more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, to render it an habitation both curious and ſtately, as being the place not only of his birth, but bearing the name of his family. The firſt object that preſented it ſelfe to our eyes, was a beautifull Towne, though more in the quality then in the quantity of the houſes, built in ſuch a juſt uniformity, that it became a queſtion to my imagination, whether the order or the materials ſhould have the greater preheminence in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſince the one in a pleaſant proſpective plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſight, as the other in a mature conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſatisfied the underſtanding: for as <hi>Cypres</hi>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98927:215"/>each angle ſupported by a goodly <hi>Pavilion,</hi> eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their guilded heads above the reſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, whilſt two Galleries of either ſide joyned by a portall of ſeverall coloured Marble, incloſed in a large Court that only at the further end made a brave Tarras, paved artificially with Moyſayck work, and bounded by raile and baller of <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian</hi> Braſſe, where upon both ſides the ſtaires up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on double pedeſtalls of <hi>Porphir,</hi> were placed the two ſtatues of <hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> The outward Court round about the walls ſeemed to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Urmes, mixt with halfe ſtatues of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Grecians, whilſt the entrance being open at the top the architrave freeze and corniſh were cut off in the middle, and finiſhed with Cartooſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of meeting. The gate of either part was ſupported by <hi>Jonick</hi> pillars, two behind and one before, which made a returne in the building, and foure guilded Lions upon low pedeſtals ſeemed to guard the paſſage. After we had traverſed theſe beautifull incloſures, we were let into the gardens for the more conveniency of ſhade, ſince the day already began to be enflamed by the Suns violence, which for the more curioſity were ordered into ſeverall diſcents, ſupported by huge Arches of white Marble, and in many places ſo covered with excellent Fruit trees, that they ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a farre off, to be painted over with delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Landskips of woods, whilſt the Birds and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incloſed in the vaults ſent forth a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing murmur to the aire. The firſt garden al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were leſſe then all the reſt, becauſe it might afford a better proſpect upon the other,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98927:215"/>was divided into foure ſquares, each conteining a magnificent fountaine, the one having the brazen ſtatue of <hi>Hercules</hi> with his club in his hand, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned about with a Chriſtall lake, wherein were Fiſhes ſo gentle by education, that they waited in the water to be fed by thoſe that viewed the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities. The ſuperfice of the pond was formed into twelve angles, and raiſed three foot high by a certaine calle of cut ſtone, that reſembled a hedge, whereupon each point was put, one of his labours artificially caſt in mettle. The ſecond water worke repreſented the naked figures of <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> and her Nymphes in white Marble; however ſo ſhadowed by a dainty grove planted by Art for that purpoſe, that their whole ſhapes could not perfectly be diſcovered, though there appeared enough for delight and admiration, whilſt poore <hi>Actaeon</hi> without the trees in a green plat of ground ſeemed to be torne in pieces by his own houndes, according to the judgement given againſt him by the revengefull goddeſs, though his friends in every place out of the buſhes, appeared to haſte to his reſcue. The third fountaine was only of <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and <hi>Thisbe,</hi> with the tragicall event of their loves. And the laſt figured the fates of <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander,</hi> where her Tower being built in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other lake, which received its current from the firſt, made a kind of confuſed, though little Sea, wherein the compaſſionate Nymphes by exact expreſſions, were apprehended to bewaile the lovely Youths death, whilſt his diſtracted love, caſt her ſelfe from the battlements of her own lodgings, to accompany him in his buriall.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98927:216"/>But that which moſt delighted my ſenſes (becauſe it afforded a pleaſing proſpective between divers rowes of even ſet Trees) was a certaine banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting houſe, built after the forme of a round Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, with large windowes of bright glaſſe, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by guilded pillars, notwithſtanding it had a portall, to give it entrance, of many tranſparent columnes, or at leaſtwiſe they ſo appeared to my view at a diſtance; the materials that built it, were yellow minerals, enterlaced with ſhells of mother of Pearle, ſo that the ſtructure reſembled a Tower of gold garniſhed with jewels; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhelered over head in every place but before, by united cypreſſes, it repreſented to my imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, a rich Tabernacle in a ſtately Pavillions ſince the Trees were ſo tall, that they gave it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a ſhady luſtre, then a darke coverture. Scarce had I contemplated this pleaſant object, but that <hi>Philos</hi> invited me to a neerer taſte of the beauty, it being to be paſt over by a Bridge ſilver'd over, ſince the houſe it ſelfe was ſeared in an Iſland made by the winding courſe of a naturall River, though many artificiall ſtreames from it, ſeemed to contribute ſome aſſiſtance to the running Brooke.</p>
                  <p>At our arrivall (having ſpent a quarter of an houres time in deſcending the ſeverall ſorts of ſtaires, that carried us into the lower Gardens) we might encounter with our eyes, at the firſt opening of the doore, the Lady <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> newly come out of the water, ſcarce having covered her modeſty with a Lawne ſmock; neither did our ſurpriſall ſeem to haſten the accommodation of
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:98927:216"/>that light coverture to the beſt advantage, as if ſhe were ſo farre from being aſhamed to be taken in that poſture, that ſhe rather expreſt a deſire to have her beauties ſtill ſeen; her haire was at full length, though curiouſly curled, which preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to deſigne, and not to accident, ſince two waiting-women in Nymphs attire, held a great Looking-glaſſe before her, whilſt ſhe carefully dreſt her face with certaine black patches, cut into the forms of Flies, and other ſmall creatures, for the better ornament of her lookes: her legs were bare, onely ſhe wore upon her feet a paire of rich embroydered pantobles: This, as neere as I can remember, was the ſtate we found her in. And very neere certainly you were, ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> that you could diſcover ſo much. At which words <hi>Narciſſus</hi> began to bluſh, proteſting alſo with a pretty violence; that he was ſo farre from liking her in that poſture, that he was as much diſpleaſed as aſhamed at her immodeſly. Well, well, replied the Princeſſe, goe on in your ſtory, without theſe impertinencies, ſince none laies any fault to your charge. Which command was too peremptory from his faire Miſtreſſe, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue him in any longer diſputation; ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</p>
                  <p>But however, ſaid he, although ſhe put on no baſhfull amazement in her countenance, yet with a diſdainfull frown ſhe ſeemed to entertaine our company, which was a ſufficient injunction to cauſe us ſpeedily to retire; and that gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Philos</hi> (ſince we had already travelled enough over thoſe walkes) to command us to be
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:98927:217"/>conducted up into the houſe, where we might be more conveniently ſhaded from the heat of the day; and that quickly brought us into the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, where excellent pictures, not enough to be eſteemed, and rich cabbinets beyond valuation, gave our thoughts and eyes an abundance of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, untill a delicious dinner called us into another room, where we found <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> ſearce ſeeming to be the ſame woman we left her in the Garden; having not onely put off altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her choler, but alſo being trimmed up with ſo exquiſite a neatneſſe, as if ſhe had been prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for her Nuptiall Feaſt; which confirmes my opinion, that all thoſe poſtures were deſigned of purpoſe, to make me think ſhe was admirable in every ſhape, as well when nature played the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe wanton, as when art became the curious painter. Bvt in concluſion, a few complements ſet us all at table, where lovely pages like <hi>Gany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meds</hi> fill'd our Wine rather in Diamonds then Chriſtiall glaſſes, whilſt our fruit ſeemed to be fetcht from the <hi>Heſperides,</hi> all ſo excellent; that could not be imitated, much leſſe equalled; yet that excellency was elevated, I will not ſay aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by raviſhing Muſick, both of voyces and Inſtruments, that with a gentle harmony, rather bewitched then burdened the eare; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued untill direction was given to take away the cloth, that the room might be emptied of all attendants, to give us the greater liberty for our private converſation, a cuſtome in that Country for the better recreation, ſince they uſed not to remove preſently after dinner: however we all
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98927:217"/>continued for ſome time in a perfect ſilence, they perhaps expecting what <hi>I</hi> ſhould ſay of my noble entertainment, and their uncles greatneſſe; and <hi>I,</hi> not being over willing to adminiſter occaſion of diſcourſe, till at laſt <hi>Philos</hi> himſelfe brake out in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Siſter, ſaid he, although <hi>I</hi> muſt confeſſe we have largely tafted of your bounty, though more of your near curioſity, a property I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that better becomes youthfull Ladies; yet it ſhould ſeem before dinner, you were too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of your retiredneſſe, in ſuffering ſtrangers to be eye-witneſſes of thoſe beauties which you have deſigned only for him that is to be your husband, as rich Jewels that are to be lockt up in cloſe Cabinets, not to be expoſed to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar view. Brother, anſwered <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> with a ſpightfull haſte, although it be true that it was contrary to the intention of my innocent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, in that poſture to be ſurprized by your wandring intention; yet certainly I am leſſe aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the accident, when I conſider you beheld nothing, that either I may be deprived of, or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fily can be equalled by other Ladies of my yeeres; onely all the feare I have is, leſt the ſcandall may prove offenſive to this worthy ſtranger, that I have ſo great ambition to content, that I ſhould beſhrew any occaſion that might render me ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in his opinion, ſince the intereſt of my blood and converſation I know muſt alwaies keep me ſafe in yours:</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſſe this complement, or rather ſtrange expreſſion of <hi>Attemeſia,</hi> put me in ſome
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98927:218"/>confuſion; conſidering of one ſide; if I gave her no anſwer at all, it might be interpreted an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull rudeneſſe, having received ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite entertainment, pretended onely for my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, after my long ſickneſſe; and of the other part, what reply ſoever I could make, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from accuſtomed rules of civility, would of neceſſity engage my words to the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of her perfections, which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſome other paſſionate progreſſe of that love I ſo much diſliked: however, at laſt I fell upon this reſolution, to involve my anſwer into ſuch a riddle, that either could not be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or being ſo, it might imply a double fence, which I delivered in this ſort: Madam, ſaid I, your beauties reſemble the innocency of the firſt Ages, that thought vertues were not to be hid from the ignorant world, nor imperfections to be mask'd by any art, whereby the rude multitude might alwaies have a book open, to learn know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and practice goodneſſe, which was the beſt way to avoid ill, when naked truth was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written character for their inſtructions. This reply, although it did not for the preſent well ſatisfie, becauſe it ſeemed not to flame by the stroake of the flint, that had produced ſparkles, as they believed, to ſet on fire the youthfull Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my heart; yet of the other ſide, it left not an abſolute deſpaire in their opinions, that at laſt I might be warmed by their motions: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, for that time the coldneſſe of my anſwer, changed the ſubject of our diſcourſe to other talke, that I confeſſe, I approved of; which with
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98927:218"/>many varieties, continued us untill the evening warned us to depart, and brought us to our old habitation; where, at our arrivall, we found a Meſſenger newly come from <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> attending to certifie <hi>Philos,</hi> that his great uncle <hi>Philoſtros</hi> was taken ſuddenly with a dangerous ſickneſſe, inſomuch as many of his Phyſicians very much doubted of his recovery; but however he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the news from all the houſe, yet the next morning very early, it cauſed him to take his journey, leaving me in the interim onely to be accompanied by his gallant ſiſter; who having the raines abſolutely in her own hands, let her paſſions runne with a full careere; for finding that all theſe trials had not wrought at all upon my affection, or got the leaſt ground of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſince the burning coales brought by <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids</hi> diligence from his mothers luxurious Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, had not yet thaw'd my icy thoughts. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temeſia</hi> fell to work new ſtratagems, ſo that one morning, I being in a private Library belonging to my lodgings, where commonly I ſpent ſome houres in the day, in conferring with thoſe books I moſt deſired to read, and viewing the Maps of ſeverall Countries for my recreation; of a ſudden I might heare the dolefull voyce of a certaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, divided from my knowledge by a partitian wall at the end of the room, which quickly made me curious enough to be informed of the nature of the complaint: wherefore approaching neerer and leaning my head cloſe to the diviſion, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſtantly ſatisfied, that the noyſe proceeded from no other then from <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> which did
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:98927:219"/>not a little increaſe my wonder, ſince I conceived her much beyond all misfortune: however I was reſolved to be fully inſtructed, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſetling my eares to an entire attentiveneſſe, in diſtinct words I heard this language.</p>
                  <p>O unhappy <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> ſaid ſhe, is it poſſible that thy owne beauty is of ſo poor a valew, that it hath not the power to attract the leaſt regard from a youthfull eye, which hath been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med heretofore, to inflame all the hearts of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria?</hi> or is thy Uncles dignity fallen in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the world, ſince a ſtranger in thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as a priſoner contemnes both? O you gods of love and honour ſaid ſhe, permit not our family to be diſgraced though you be determined I ſhall periſh, ſince I cannot perſwade him I muſt hate my ſelfe; and by conſequence become a deſtroyer of us both; for as I am reſolved not to breath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuffer, ſo muſt not he live chiefely to try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; with much other goodly ſtuffe of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which I leave to repeat, becauſe I will not prophane your moſt chaſte eares, with all the particular's of her violent and ridiculous paſſion; however I was forced to dwell with my conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon two points in her mad expreſſion; the firſt was, that ſhe ſeemed to declare me a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, which untill then I never underſtood; though I muſt confeſſe, I found my liberty often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reſtrained under the pretence of a loving care of my he alth: And the other that appeared more terrible, her ſeeming reſolution, either to enjoy or to deſtroy. Which made me when I had heard enough, to retire to my own chamber; but
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:98927:219"/>many dayes I had not continued there, before I perceived by the apparent neglect of the whole houſe, <hi>Artemeſia</hi> not ſending for me according to her cuſtome, that I was held for no other then a priſoner, being every night locked into my lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by an officious Groom. All which was done as I underſtood to bring downe my proud and Icy heart, to comply with her deſires; her nurſe in the interim giving me many items of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; beſides, I might behold every day out of my chamber window, the rich and glorious triumphes of my inſolent Miſtreſſe, when ſhee mounted her Chariot to take the aire for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, or performed ſome other viſits for her pleaſure. And that the ſplendor might more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to my thoughts, as intended affronts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning my low condition &amp; captivity, ſhe cauſed an ordinary way to be made by my doore, where ſhe daily paſt with mirth in her countenance and ſcorn in her language; to ſhew ſhe had not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgot her old love, but the very remembrance I was in the houſe; whilſt in the meane time the foreſaid nurſe would now and then give me a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, as it were covertly out of pitty, to comfort up my thoughts againſt her Ladies rigour; however I very well knew her intention was but the better to diſcover my reſolutions; nevertheleſſe, with all which humours I was content to play, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void any further incumbrance of her Miſtreſſe offered affection, not doubting but at her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers returne I ſhould be able to procure my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſement, the only happineſſe I aymed at, though my endeavours were not of force to prevent this
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:98927:220"/>following miſchiefe; for <hi>Artemeſia</hi> finding that no artifice could make me entertaine her love, or adore her perſon, ſince the heavens knew I had a brighter deity to worſhip, which kept me from all ſuperſtitious Idolatry, began to be enamoured with her own revenge, and ſo reſolved to make me become a Martyr before my time: wherefore one day comming into my chamber, when I leaſt looked for her company, her own pride as I thought, having forbid her entrance, bearing in her hand a ſhort dagger, as in her countenance a rough tempeſt, ſaluted me with this deſperate language: Villain, ſaid ſhe, doſt thou think to carry the Trophies of my diſhonour into thy own Country, to adorne the chariot of thy Miſtreſſes triumphes, with thoſe ſpoyles thy diſdaine hath purchaſed in this Caſtle, to the diſgrace of our whole family? and with that ſtruck at my naked breaſt, being newly unbuttoned by reaſon of the heat of the weather, with ſuch a womans vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that I muſt confeſſe, my quick prevention had fortune enough to avoyd the danger of the ſtroake, though not ſo much power as to hinder her rage; for finding I had not only defended my ſelfe againſt her intended and malicious fury, but endeavoured to become an abſolute conquerour over her mad paſſion, by ſtriving to diſpoſſeſſe her alſo of her weapon, with a ſpleen more infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall then humane, becauſe ſhe could not hurt me, ſhe reſolved to wound her ſelfe, whereby I might be eſteemed the greater criminall, to take off that blemiſh which hung upon her reputation by her too violent love; but the ſtroake proved more
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98927:220"/>deadly then perhaps ſhe imagined, for it not only pierced her arme, where ſhe onely intended it, but by reaſon of the ſharpneſſe of the point, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred a great depth into her naked ſide, which with the effuſion of a great deale of bloud (that at laſt called up moſt part of the houſe to her aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) left her dead in the view of all the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. This ſad diſaſter, as you may imagine, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inraged the whole company, and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving me either the actor, or the inſtrument of the Tragedy, with all violence haled me to a cloſer priſon in the Caſtle, whilſt according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of thoſe parts, my proceſſe was to be made the next morning by the Juſtice of the Towne, before the body could either be buried or imbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. This accident gave my confuſed thoughts ſufficient imployment; however I made a great queſtion whether I ſhould confeſſe my name, or conceale my condition, finding by my citation, I was only called the ungratefull ſtranger, which gave me ſome opinion that my quality was not generally knowne in the City; believing as the one would not at all help to leſſen the crime pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt me, but rather give the more ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a hidden deſigne, in that I durſt attempt a murther of that horrid nature, which an ordinary perſon would never have performed, ſo the other might in ſome ſort helpe to hide the ſhame to our Family, in being called to a publick defence in a caſe of ſuch a wickedneſſe: wherefore I determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to reveale my ſelfe, untill ſome apparent neceſſity procured it.</p>
                  <p>At my arraignment, there was alleadged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:98927:221"/>me beſides the breach of the rules of hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, how that it was impoſſible any other could commit the murther, ſince <hi>Artemeſia</hi> was found alone with me in my chamber; and it was not to be ſuppoſed ſhe had killed her ſelfe. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teary, I pretended that being a meer ſtranger in thoſe parts, it could not be imagined I ſhould harbour ſo much malice in my breaſt, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the murtherer of one that had treated me in my ſickneſſe with abundance of humanity; beſides I ſaid, the weapon which had given <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſia</hi> her deadly wound, was found by all the company in her own hand: but the buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to and fro violently diſputed, <hi>Arteme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia's</hi> nurſe was ſent for to give further reſtimony of my carriage towards her Miſtreſſe during my aboade in the Caſtle, which could not chuſe but give in the opinion of all there preſent, a great deale of light in the diſputation; however, the malicious old woman imagining her declarations might afforde me ſome aſſiſtance, refuſed to come, pretending ſhe was neceſſarily imployed in the Funerall of her dead Miſtreſſe, being locked up with the body in her private chamber; though the truth was, ſhe thirſted after my life to ſave the honour of <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> and the whole family, ſince by that meanes I ſhould not have the opportunity to divulge her prepoſterous love; ſo that at laſt I was not only found guilty, but condemned pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately to loſe my head within the Caſtle court; fearing belike in my laſt ſpeech I would publiſh ſome paſſages, that might render the people ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of my innocency, and <hi>Artemeſia's</hi> laſciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98927:221"/>Thus finding all my honeſt Rhetorick, could not prevaile in my juſt defence to ſecure me from condemnation, I reſolved to declare my perſon, hoping that although it might not prove of ſufficient force to divert my judgement, yet nevertheleſſe it would be a motive to prot act my execution untill <hi>Philos</hi> returned from <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> which declaration happily met with my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For after the Judges with much amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had entertained the knowledge of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, being the ſon of him who was eſteemed ſo intimate a friend to the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> they not only preſently ſigned my reprive, but conveyed me with all the reſpect their laws would give them leave, back againe to the priſon, where I remained untill <hi>Philos</hi> returne, who brought with him the newes of <hi>Philoſtros</hi> death and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, though foure dayes time was ſpent after his arrivall before he offered me a viſit, in which ſpace I had liberty enough for conſideration what would be my fate: At laſt he came and ſaluted me with this diſcourſe to my no ſmall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>My Lord ſaid he, I muſt not onely deſire you to forget all your ill uſage in this Caſtle, but to interpret the reaſons, to have proceeded from a womans unruly paſſion (for I cannot give it a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Title) without my privity, which my future actions, and my preſent diſcourſe ſhall teſtifie, if either you will believe my words, or pardon my intentions. Be pleaſed then in ſhort to know, for my reſolution is to make unto you a particular confeſſion, and after commit my ſelfe unto your
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98927:222"/>goodneſſe and mercy, that when you and the faire Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> were at <hi>Memphis</hi> with <hi>Orſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> it was my fortune to be conquered by the power of love, proceeding not only from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of her beauty and converſation, but as I may ſay was thruſt upon me by ſuch a forcible and precipitate fate, that could not to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the power of any reaſon or temper; in ſo much as I muſt tell you, in regard of thoſe paſſions, I could neither eate, ſleep, nor reſt with convenient ſatisfaction; ſo that I conceived my ſelfe obliged for my preſervation, to contrive a project with the <hi>Lydian</hi> Ambaſſadour then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining at <hi>Memphis,</hi> which was to interrupt your paſſage at Sea going into <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whereby the better to make a ſeparation between your love, and that which the Princeſſe bore you, that both mine, and my ſiſter <hi>Artemeſias</hi> might ſucceed in the places: And however the gods prevented ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the manner of the execution, then the effect of our deſignes, by contrary ſtormes and acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents at Sea, yet I muſt now enforme you, that as your ſelfe by fortune were taken by our ſhips, which hath ſince produced this late diſmall miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap concerning my ſiſter, ſo the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> by chance falling upon the Coaſts of the Iſland of <hi>Creet,</hi> is now delivered into the poſſeſſion of the Senate of <hi>Lydia;</hi> and they as I am enformed, from thoſe Ambaſſadors of our Country that are at <hi>Sardis,</hi> intend with ſome violence to beſtow her in marriage upon her Conſin <hi>Caſſianus</hi> Prince of <hi>Iberia,</hi> whereby the better to fortifie their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Titles againſt King <hi>Euarchus</hi> her father;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:98927:222"/>however they ſeemed for a long time to play with my hopes, as if they only intended her for my ſatisfaction, belike imagining that ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation would alwayes be ſufficient to continue our family faithfull to their purpoſes, and ſo conſequently make my Uncle <hi>Philoſtros</hi> ever wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to imploy his power with <hi>Orſames</hi> for their advantages; but he being now dead (which newes they have already received in <hi>Lydia</hi>) they publickly diſclaime from having any ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as believing now we can no more contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute profitably to their deſignes: wherefore as my thoughts and reſolutions intend a preſent retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſome place of religion, to ſeek pardon of the gods for my many violent and unjuſt ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo did I very well know, their mercies in no kind were to be obtained, without ſuch a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar declaration of my own faults, which I have now made unto you: as I can no way doubt of your charity and compaſſion in my behalfe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nobleneſſe of your nature; ſo may you be pleaſed to take what free liberty you pleaſe for your departure, with a promiſe alſo on my part to be ready to aſſiſt you with my beſt ſervices, either in your loves to the faireſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, or upon what other occaſion ſoever that may make you better honoured and eſteemed in the world. After he had delivered thus much, I muſt confeſſe I was ſo well ſatisfied with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; not onely in regard of your ſafety, but alſo in reſpect of my own releaſement, that <hi>Philos</hi> imagined as I then thought by my preſent actions and expreſſion, that I meant to run away from him,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98927:223"/>for ſuddainly taking me by the hand, he ſaid he had a few more words to deliver unto me, that concerned his ſiſters proceedings, ſince he held it moſt neceſſary his own innocency might be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for that in no particular he proteſted, was he guilty of my laſt uſage.</p>
                  <p>As I cannot deny ſaid he, but that I kindled the firſt ſparkles by my commendation of your perſon and worth, that afterward flamed ſo violently in my ſiſters boſome; ſo of the other ſide, I never expected it ſhould have broken out to ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous paſſion, whereby you were to be injured without meaſure, as my ſiſter deſtroyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond example: But as the Gods have their ſecret workings in all humane things, we muſt with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reverence ſubmit all our endeavours to their pleaſure, which will for the moſt part keep us from extravagant and wicked actions; ſince however ſometimes we might faile by miſpriſion, yet by a ſmall repentance we ſhould againe be brought into our accuſtomed temper, when as letting looſe the reines of our deſires without moderation, we are borne into a vaſt Sea of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, that produceth nothing but prodigious deſtructions, as it fared with <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> who was reſolved becauſe ſhe could not obtaine ſuddenly what her own thoughts perhaps eſteemed lawfull, to convert that paſſion to ſo ſtrange a hate, that of neceſſity would not onely render the object of her wiſhes nothing, but her ſelfe miſerable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of ever being able to enjoy what ſhe ſo much longed for; however her old nurſes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, although they did not contribute to her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98927:223"/>yet they produced thoſe projects that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed your ill uſage; for finding you were not by any faire meanes to be wonne to my ſiſters deſires, ſhe adviſed her to aſſay the contrary, to try if that courſe could terrifie you to conſent: All which <hi>Artemeſia</hi> confeſſed before her death, her body a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine reviving after it was brought into her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chamber, as alſo with many Teares and ſighes entreated your pardon, which I thought good to acquaint you with, that her unfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance might procure your charitable forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: And with that taking me by the hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with teeres in his eyes, he deſired me as a teſtimony of a perfect reconciliation, I would vouchſafe the paines to viſit the dead Corpes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Funerals, which ſhortly were to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>Although I went with him as fully contented in my minde, as he ſeemed oppreſſed with ſorrow for his ſiſters death; yet I could not chuſe but have a noble compaſſion at the remembrance of the Ladies hard fate, eſpecially for that the cauſe was only for over much loving me, but at my arrivall inſtead of imbracing the dead body, to my won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful amazement, I was ſaluted with theſe words from living <hi>Artemeſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lord ſaid ſhe, that you may not think you converſe with dead, (though changed) <hi>Artemeſia,</hi> you muſt firſt know, that after I had performed in your Lodgings that unparalleld action of my mad rage, bathed all over with mine own bloud, I was carried into my chamber, whilſt you unknowne to me was in danger to have ſuffered
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:98927:224"/>unjuſtly for my fault: And being there by the carefull induſtry of mine own Phyſitian, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the privity of any, but ſuch as were intruſted about my perſon, I was not onely recovered from my trance, but before my brothers arrivall put out of danger of death; however, I deſired the buſineſſe might be kept ſecret from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all but my intimate ſervants, ſince I was reſolved to quit the world by a more religious way, not being willing to ſupport the ſhame of ſo deteſtable a fact: yet conſidering that an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute repentance could not be, where there wants an intention of full ſatisfaction, I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous with my own mouth, to make this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration before I enter into the ſtrict rules of my pennance, by which I humbly and ſorrowfully beg your pardon, wiſhing a perpetuall proſperity to the chaſte loves between you and the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria.</hi> And this, my Lord, being all I have to ſay to you, I deſire you will have no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me, then meerly what charity inſtructs your pious thoughts. And with theſe words ſhe drew cloſe the Curtaines of her bed, not willing to be ſeen, or any more ſpoken withall.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, I muſt confeſſe, rather appeared to my imagination viſions then actions, untill with as much honour as could be deviſed, I was ſet free by <hi>Philos,</hi> who alſo courteouſly offered to accompany me with his beſt ſervice in my journey; but becauſe I was reſolved to viſit the place of your aboad in a diſguize, not onely for that I knew you were in the cuſtody of your
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98927:224"/>enemies; but alſo in that I had a deſire to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the way, the ſecrets of the Senates inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concerning <hi>Caſſianus</hi> love, which I muſt confeſſe gave my thoughts ſome trouble, I refuſed his offer.</p>
                  <p>As this diſcourſe ſeemed to give a ſingular content to the lovely Princeſſe, demonſtrated by many viſible ſignes, both in her eyes and bluſhes; ſo <hi>Roxana,</hi> who had all the while, with a moſt exact attentiveneſſe, given eare to his ſeverall relations, uttered this language, with a kind of a formall gravity: Truly my Lord, ſaid ſhe, you have not onely gallantly now cleared all our doubts and feares, but alſo in my opinion have carried your ſelfe in your difficult adventures, more like a valiant Martyr, then a conſtant lover, which I muſt confeſſe deſerves both praiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall: and yet Governeſſe, ſaid the Princeſſe, we muſt not commend him overmuch, leſt he expect a greater reward then we ſhall be willing to afford him. Deare <hi>Cloria,</hi> replied <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> I cannot but confeſſe my own covetouſneſſe, ſince no leſſe a preſent can content my thoughts, then your admirable ſelfe, which is a Jewell beyond the price of the whole world: But ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> the chiefe property of Jewels, are to be looked upon at a diſtance; wherefore, if you will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied onely with that liberty and moderation, perhaps I ſhall without much difficulty grant your requeſt, Yet Madam, replied <hi>Roxana,</hi> it is moſt neceſſary he make choice of ſome other apparrell, better to become his perſon; ſo may you have both the conveniency now and then to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98927:225"/>meet in theſe walkes without ſuſpition, untill the confuſion now in the Kingdome afford you a greater liberty. But <hi>Narciſſus</hi> moſt earneſtly entreated to be entertained at a neerer diſtance; however without fruit, in regard both <hi>Cloria</hi> and <hi>Roxana</hi> apprehended, that his paſſion to ſee <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſometimes received as a ſuitor, though but with appearing complements, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to ſome actions, which might either prejudice their liberties, or diſcover his perſon; for that neither of them could yet be over-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> intentions and fidelity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the old <hi>Flamin,</hi> although he had not ſince their late diſcourſe, either ſhewed any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſcontent, or ſo much as troubled them with viſits. <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> when he ſaw he could not by any means prevaile in his deſire, as if he had been at the inſtant poſſeſt with ſome Poeticall fury, began this complaint in verſe; which the Princeſſe, being excellent alſo in that faculty, as quickly anſwered <hi>extempore.</hi>

                  <p>After the Princeſſe had thus perſwaded <hi>Narciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to be contented, finding the time of the day gave them no more opportunity, ſhe roſe up to returne to the Caſtle; however aſſuring him as often as ſhe could without danger to her ſelfe ſhe would frequent thoſe walkes for his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; This being the decree all the favours poore

                  <p>This ſudden intelligence gave <hi>Clorias</hi> thoughts ſome trouble, doubting a diſaſterous adventure, the rather for that her newly being wakened from the Ideas of her chiefe delight, it ſeemed to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt her apprehenſion with a contrary feare, of being diſpoſſeſt of what ſhe had enjoyed by her flattering fancy; however ſhe called <hi>Roxana</hi> to accompany her in the expectation, commanding the little meſſenger not only to uſher in that ſtranger, that ſeemed ſo importunate, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward himſelfe to wait in the outward roome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe would have none privy to the buſineſſe, before ſhe and Governeſſe were informed of the contents.</p>
                  <p>But no ſooner did <hi>Cloria</hi> view this new intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but but ſhe knew him to be him whom ſhe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:98927:227"/>moſt deſired to ſee, her young ſervant <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who had borrowed the habite of one of <hi>Apollos</hi> Prieſts, in a Temple where he lodged the night paſt amongſt the woods, to keep him from every ones knowledge but her own, and her intruſted Governeſſe <hi>Roxanae:</hi> nevertheleſſe the rigid old woman began to raile downe right at his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, vowing with his too much paſſion he would deſtroy the all; this gave <hi>Cloria</hi> occaſion to laugh heartily, ſeeing her poor ſervant with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent looks, to undergoe the cholerick reproofe of <hi>Roxana,</hi> without replying one ſingle word to her haſty language, yet his patience not only by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little procured him his peace; but after a long conference with his compaſſionate Miſtreſſe, by the free conſent of her Governeſſe, who at laſt became perſwaded, he was entertained for a houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſervant; however the ſweet Princeſſe ſeemed unwilling to prophance his ſacred robes with any hypocriſie.</p>
                  <p>But one day <hi>Caſſiamus</hi> comming to viſit the Princeſſe, the gods know with what an envious jealouſie <hi>Narciſſus</hi> underwent this ceremonies; ſometimes he had a will to have interrupted his paſſage at the entrance into her chamber; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while againe he thought to have alleadged ſhe was aſleep, and could not be diſquieted in her reſt; and laſt of all he began to have a reſolution to quit his borrowed habit, and challenge him for his boldneſſe, in pretending in his preſence to his right: And a thouſand other fancies entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his imagination, almoſt in an inſtant, when there was no more time leſt him for theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98927:228"/>derations; but whilſt <hi>Cloria</hi> was advertized of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> arrivall, and he admitted into her chamber; whither <hi>Narciſſus</hi> followed him with greedy ſteps to be a curious eye witneſſe of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour: And when he ſaw <hi>Cloria</hi> with a gentle modeſly admit of her Couſins ſalutation, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not willing to give him any diſcontent, by reaſon of the old <hi>Flamine</hi> that was at his mercy, his colour began to change in his face; one while the beautifull red ſeemed to claime an intereſt in revenge, notwithſtanding all the prohibitions of his ſweet Miſtreſſe: then againe the faire white had the prerogative, and pretended feare to <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> commands; ſo that in this manner they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leſt combating in his lovely countenance, untill he was rid of the occaſion of thoſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
                  <p>Not many dayes after <hi>Caſſianus</hi> had performed his unwelcome viſit, the Senate belike jealous of the Princeſſe ſafety, in regard the King her father had been ſtrangely reſcued from their power by that Army that not long before they eſteemed their Subject, ſuddenly commanded not onely thoſe ſervants to be removed from their accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med attendance that had been about her perſon, but her ſelfe and <hi>Roxana</hi> to be conducted to a ſtronger Fort, there to remaine with better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and more honour as they pretended, until the preſent diſtractions of <hi>Lydia</hi> could in ſome ſort be pacified; in which number poor <hi>Narciſſus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came alſo preſcribed, which converted his paſt content into an unexpreſſible rage; ſome time blaming the heavens for not puniſhing the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98927:228"/>as he interpreted it, of the unjuſt and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons decree, then againe he abſolutely fell out with himſelfe, that he had not ability beyond humance force, to prevent the execution of ſuch a pernicious command. But alaſſe, his vaine paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were ſo farre from defending the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> againſt that violence offered to her perſon, that he had not ſo much liberty as by one deare kiſſe to take leave of her white hand, amongſt the reſt of her traine, who were admitted to that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull honour: for the rigid guard finding by his diſtracted lookes, and extravagant words, that he had not patience enough in his breaſt, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply punctually with their ſtrict commiſſion, quickly diſcharged him from his ordinary atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, before they diſpoſed of the reſt of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. This accident ſoon retired <hi>Narciſſus</hi> into the neighbouring woods, there to complaine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Rocks and ſtones of the greatneſſe of the Princeſſe injury, and his owne misfortunes, in which place he remained in his wilde paſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till want of food and lodging, conſtrained him to turne his thoughts to conſider his preſent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to that purpoſe reſolved to ſeek ſome ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, where he might receive entertainement, untill he could further diſpoſe of his determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince he found theſe fruitleſſe ſorrowes and diſtracted expreſſions, neither eaſed his griefe or profited his love. Wherefore after he had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led three or foure dayes in the vaſt Forreſt, with ſuch proviſion only as he could get in poore and contemptible Cottages, as he paſt through a thick wood, which ſeemed to obſcure a certaine Plaine
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98927:229"/>that lay beyond it, his melancholy eares of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den were ſaluted with a certaine kind of rude muſick, that appeared alſo more confuſed, for that it was at many periods accompanied with the loud acclamacions of common people. As this ſeemed a ſtrange adventure to his imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after ſuch an abſolute ſilence for ſo many dayes in his ſolitary perambulation, where dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ecchoes appeared to have beene in a manner his only companions; with the uncouth fall of waters from high and unacceſſible precipices; ſo the unexpected newneſſe againe of probability of humane converſation, put on a little his deſire to be curious, though ſcarce was he willing to allow himſelfe any content at all, ſince ſhe that was the delight of his ſoule, had been forcibly ſeparated from his ſight; nevertheleſſe proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his intention, he directed his ſteps towards the place where he heard the noyſe, through the intangled Bryers, and almoſt impaſſable buſhes, which ſufficiently moderated his haſte, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his march, yet at laſt with much paine, he arrived neere the outſide of the wood, where he might perceive through the branches of the trees, in a ſpacious Plaine, a great many of Countrey people gathered about a little Altar, raiſed ſix ſteps above the ground; at which ſtood an old Prieſt offering ſacrifice to the god <hi>Pan,</hi> as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his ſtatue placed upon certaine baſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of rough ſtone, and with more unpoliſhed workmanſhip. This diſcovery invited <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to attend the iſſue with ſilence, and the rather for that at every full point, and ſtop of the Prieſt in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98927:229"/>his devotions, the multitude ſuddenly took hands in a joyfull agreement one with another, and danced many rounds, about the Image in a rurall manner, to the only Muſicke of their untunable voyces, though a certaine ditty, which he could not underſtand by any words they uttered, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to expreſſe the intention of their mirth, though onely knowne to themſelves in reſpect of the rudeneſſe of the language, and the harſhneſſe of the delivery.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Narciſſus</hi> had a long time enterteined his wonder with the ſight of this underſtanding of the reaſon of their aſſembly, he approached nearer the company, with an intention to enquire of ſome ſtanding by, not onely what the occaſion might be of that ſolemnity, but how he ſhould the readieſt way find out the next convenient Towne to give him reception; And the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity fitted well with his deſire; for the Prieſt having performed all the rights and ceremonies belonging to his office, was newly retired ſome diſtance from the multitude, to a ſmall riſing banke; as well to repoſe himſelfe, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with greater conveniency the continued ſport, wherein he ſeemed to have more then an ordinary intereſt, which made <hi>Narciſſus</hi> quickly addreſſe himſelfe to him with this courteous language.</p>
                  <p>Father ſaid he, I hope it is the cuſtome in theſe parts, eſpecially amongſt thoſe of your profeſſion, not to take ill any curioſity of a ſtranger, that ſeekes civilly to be enformed as well in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98927:230"/>of the Countrey where he paſſeth, as of a convenient place that may give him entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that I may prevent your demand which I make no doubt will ſeem neceſſary to your judgement, be pleaſed to know that I am by birth of the Iſland of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and intending a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to the Temple of <hi>Delphos,</hi> am by chance fallen into your company.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſt ſeeing himſelfe ſaluted by a young man, though in his own habit of ſuch an excellent beauty, and ſo perfect a ſhape, preſently not only roſe up from his ſeat, to give him the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfull welcome, but told him for his lodging the night to come, ſince the time of the day per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps might prevent him of a better conveniency, he ſhould hold it an extraordinary honour, that his own poor habitation might performe the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: and the rather as he ſaid for that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions ſeemed to agree by the outward reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Robes. <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was not much diſpleaſed with the offer, as well becauſe he found himſelfe ſomething weary by reaſon of thoſe extravagant and uncertaine journeyes he had made, as alſo that he might hope by this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to get further information concerning his own reſolutions, that yet he had not fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined. Wherefore after he had returned the Father a civill thankes for his favour, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation he was willing to accept of his charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble kindneſſe, they both ſate downe together up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the bankſide, to behold the finiſhing of thoſe rurall delights, that paſſionately ſeemed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Countrey people, which gave occaſion
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98927:230"/>to <hi>Narciſſus</hi> to demand the reaſon of that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary mirth, that poſſeſſed the thoughts of the whole company. The Prieſt after he had a little ſimiled to thinke of the ſtrangers apprehenſion, told him, ſince he perceived his curioſity went ſo farre as to be ſatisfied in thoſe petty affaires, he would take the paines to let him know the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall that produced the effects, which as he ſaid was the more proper for his entertainment; ſince the occaſion at the preſent detained almoſt all <hi>Aſia</hi> both in expectation and wonder; however he feared his ſtory might be too tedious for his patience. But <hi>Narciſſus</hi> ſeeming rather paſſionate at the ſatisſaction then diſtaſted at the offer; the Prieſt retired ſomething further into the woods, to be more out of the noyſe of the people, where after he had ſetled the ſtrangers expectation to a ſilent attentiveneſſe, he began this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Sir ſaid he, you muſt be pleaſed to know that our King <hi>Euarchus</hi> grandmother called <hi>Minerva,</hi> (by whoſe right he came to weare all thoſe Crownes he was once poſſeſſor of, and might ſtill have enjoyed in a proſperous meaſure, if his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes had been equall to his goodneſſe, or his Subjects loyaltie anſwerable to his own eminent worth) was a Princeſſe of ſuch excellent vertues, that it had been a controverſie between art and nature, whether had more bountifully contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the adorning of her royall perſon; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe only raigned in <hi>Myſia,</hi> a Country not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly barren in production of the fruits of the earth, but luxurious in the unfaithfulneſſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, though her birth juſtly claimed the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98927:231"/>of this rich Kingdome of <hi>Lydia</hi> after our Queen then raigning here; I ſay this admirable Princeſſe had a baſe brother alſo, named <hi>Leonatus,</hi> who wanted not ambition enough to deſire the Crowne of <hi>Myſia,</hi> though he were not furniſhed with ſufficient vertues to merit ſuch a dignity; and to this purpoſe left nothing unattempted that might either advance his own eſteem or deprave his ſiſters actions; and to that end inſinnated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by all meanes poſſible, not only into the good opinion of the Lords, but much more into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the common people; in which interim the young Princeſſe being furniſhed with youth and beauty, was perſwaded by the chiefe nobility to thinke of a noble husband that might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her in her converſation, and give the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome a hope of poſterity, two eſſentiall parts as they pretended of her own happineſſe; in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this deſire, there was preſented unto her view a handſome Lord of this our Countrey of <hi>Lydia:</hi> in concluſion the nuptials were quickly ſolemnized to the appearing content of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and the rather for that the then Queene of <hi>Lydia</hi> was well ſatisfied with the choyce, not doubting to maintaine by this meanes a continual and ſtrong intereſt in the Kingdome of <hi>Myſia,</hi> ſince ſhe had married to the Princeſſe one of her own Subjects.</p>
                  <p>But now <hi>Leonatus</hi> began to play his part; for finding this conjunction proved a bar to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention for ſucceſſion, he thought it his beſtway to eſtabliſh himſelfe notwithſtanding, a certain pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the government, and to that purpoſe ſtrived
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98927:231"/>by all meanes his malicious will could inſtruct, to gaine the good opinion of the young King, whereby to ſet him at difference with the Queen, who began to be a little diſtaſted, to ſee his wife take upon her ſo abſolute authority, he only bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the name of a Prince; which at laſt grew to ſuch a height, by the underhand provocation of wicked <hi>Leonatus,</hi> that one day when the Queene (being great with child) was retired into her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate chamber, to conferre with a certain Secretary of State, moſt imployed in the Kingdomes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, her husband of a ſudden ruſht into her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with his ſword drawne, and there before her amazed eyes ſlaughtered her poore ſervant. However this was an act of ſome horrour to the great bellied Queen, and ſo conſequently might be thought ſufficient motives of her laſting indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to ſee her ſelfe and authority ſo affronted by one ſhe had lately raiſed from being a Subject to be her husband; yet religion and good nature proved ſo powerfull in her noble diſpoſition, that upon the Kings ſorrow and ſubmiſſion, ſhe was content both to forgive the injury, and forget the diſhonour by a perfect reconciliation. But <hi>Leonatus</hi> not weary yet of his own wickedneſſe, though deſpairing of his further ability to retain his intereſt with the young King, ſince the Queen as he thought had ſo abſolutely circumvented him in that project, of a ſudden ſtroake into friendſhip with certaine factious Prieſts, that had newly brought in a religion into <hi>Myſia,</hi> that taught this dangerous Doctrine; <hi>That Princes deſerved no longer to governe, then whilſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:98927:232"/>the People.</hi> Which opinion you may very well imagine, took feelingly with the multitude, in ſo much as in a ſhort time the Queen had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment enough, to defend her perſon from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, as her Kingdome from civill warre; This exceedingly tormented her thoughts, untill the birth of her young ſonne againe revived her ſpirits: however <hi>Leonatus</hi> ſtill proſecuting his horrid deſignes to ſupplant the Queen in her juſt right, whereby to bring the government of the Kingdome under his own juriſdiction, one night ſecretly cauſed not only the young King to be cruelly murthered in his bed, in execution of his revenge, becauſe he had quitted his party, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo laid the bloudy ſlaughter, by way of private aſperſions, upon the innocent and religious Queen, the more to bring her in hatred with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who ſeemed already ſufficiently poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, by the late pernicious doctrine brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Countrey by the turbulent Prieſts: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe crafty practiſes had not as yet pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſhake, or rather abſolutely to deſtroy her grounded authority, which had been caſt upon her by ſo rightfull a ſucceſſion, yet by little and little they ſo wounded her reputation, that they made her deſire to have a faithfull companion, to aſſiſt her in her government; which politick <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> perceiving, judging it a love paſſion in the Queen, put on ſome of the nobility underhand to perſwade her, not only preſently to marry, but to take for her husband a valiant Gentleman his intimate friend, who a long time had pretended unto her love, however he was not without ſome
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:98927:232"/>ſuſpition, that he had been an actor in the Kings death; with theſe baites I ſay <hi>Leonatus</hi> ſo farre intangled the Queenes innocency, that ſhe was wonne by perſwaſion to make this election, being councelled thereunto by the chiefe nobility, ſet upon her to that purpoſe, though ſhe firſt cauſed a decree to be paſt by the unanimous conſent of all, that this Lord had been no way guilty, of the falſe aſperſion his enemies had caſt upon him, concerning the Kings murther. No ſooner were theſe nuptials ſolemnized, which was the thing <hi>Leonatus</hi> deſired, but ſecretly he admoniſhed the new King to flye, aſſuring him as his friend, that either he would be ſuddenly ſlaine by many that had conſpired his death, or publickly be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and brought to his Tryall by the conſent of the whole Kingdome; ſo that he, whether knowing himſelfe faulty indeed, or fearing the power and injuſtice of his enemies, ſince emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt his equalls had procured him a world of envy, quickly followed his advice, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately without the Queenes privity, quitted his Country and Fortunes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leonatus</hi> conceiving now he had compaſſed the hardeſt part of his projects, ſent ſecretly into <hi>Lydia</hi> to poſſeſſe the Queen there, with an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>Minerva's</hi> guilt, ſince ſhe had married the murtherer of her firſt husband; too apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as he pretended, diſcovered by his ſtrange flight: at the ſame time alſo, by the help of his factious prieſts, he raiſed tumults againſt her, in her own kingdome, whereby ſhe became impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, becauſe ſhe would not quit her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98927:233"/>This you may believe, gave the poore Queen ſufficient imployment; inſomuch as being wearied by continuall troubles, and invited to the Court of <hi>Lydia</hi> by her kinſwomans promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for her better and quiet protection, ſhe was content to reſigne the Crown to her ſonne, and accept of thoſe offers ſhe eſteemed reall. But alas, no ſooner was ſhe arrived within the bounds of this kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but contrary to her expectation, wherefore amazed in the execution, inſtead of being admitted into the Queens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with love and honour, ſhe was commanded as a priſoner to a Caſtle not farre off; whilſt in the mean time her young ſonne was committed to the tuition of <hi>Leonatus</hi> her worſt enemy; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever with this pretention, that as ſoon as ſhe could cleare her ſelfe of thoſe aſperſions and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations that her ſubjects brought againſt her, ſhe ſhould enjoy thoſe reſpects at Court which had been largely promiſed her; though in the interim ſhe muſt be content with her fortune, ſince the State of <hi>Lydia</hi> thought it not fit for one in her condition, beſpotted with the opinion of ſo black a crime, ſhould have any correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with their Queen, as 'twas pretended, of ſo bright a vertue; when the gods know, it was either the too much cleerneſſe of her own good parts, or the rightfulneſſe of her title, being of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Religion, that was the onely obſtacle of her happineſſe. But whilſt <hi>Minerva</hi> under-went for many yeeres a hard impriſonment in <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſince the Queen her ſelfe was ſo farre from eaſing her of her bonds, as ſhe would never give eare
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98927:233"/>to her complaints; the King her young ſonne began to approach to mans eſtate, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureneſſe in age, gave him a feeling of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers oppreſſions; but her enemies in <hi>Myſia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo backt from the States in theſe parts, who had an intention all they could to ſuppreſſe his greatneſſe, that he might have no power to claim his right in the kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> gave his thoughts and actions not onely continuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions, but at laſt impriſoned his very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his own kingdome. Notwithſtanding all this, the wiſe King bore theſe inſolencies with unexampled patience, knowing that as it was not in his power to free himſelfe from their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny by any Kingly pretention; ſo of the other ſide he hoped that factions amongſt themſelves would at laſt purchaſe his liberty. In this ſtate he continued, untill his Guard found that it might be prejudiciall to his Titles in <hi>Lydia,</hi> after the old Queens death, to keep him thus as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, whereby they might alſo be debarred from a plentifull ſhare of the gain, when <hi>Lydia</hi> by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion ſhould fall to him; upon theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they of a ſudden, not onely releaſed him, from his confinement, but every one of theſe men themſelves ſtrived who might be moſt in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; when as he not onely as a good natured Prince, forgot all his injuries, but became ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently pleaſed to be at liberty, upon any termes. But the old Queen of <hi>Lydia,</hi> drawing now to her laſt period, both of life and Kingdome; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it was reaſon ſufficient for a juſt jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to have the heire apparant ſo neere her juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98927:234"/>whom ſhe imagined looked upon her continuance; like a young bloſſome, that ſtrived to thruſt out the ancient and withered flower from its ſtalke, began ſuddenly to queſtion the poore Princeſſe (her ſelfe alſo being almoſt worn out by her hard uſage) about her correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with thoſe forraine powers, who were of her kindred; And not content with any anſwer the truth of her proceedings could make, called her to her triall before ordinary Commiſſioners. As theſe might be evident marks of <hi>Minerva's</hi> ruine, ſo were they not undiſcovered by the ſharp apprehenſion of the wiſe Lady, though her ſpightfull fate, would not afford her preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, notwithſtanding her excellent endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: yet as ſhe had good cauſe, ſhe excepted againſt thoſe partiall Judges deſigned for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by all the pretentions that a free Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, or an oppreſt woman could alledge, though the Queen ſeemed as deafe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This not onely brought her to a judgement-ſeat, prepared with ſome outward circumſtances fit to entertaine her dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but to a condemnation prepared with cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to bewitch the underſtanding of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, who rather deſired to behold ſtrange ſpectacles, then to be delighted in juſt actions; and in this May-game, as I may call it, of the worſt cruelty, when the form of Law was
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:98927:234"/>onely made uſe of to hide bad intentions, was this brave and religious Queen, as a period to all her fortunes, ſentenced to loſe her head. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this condemnation, the Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi> for ſome time deferred the execution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her own honour could not but ſuffer abroad, in the opinion of all other Princes, her equals, as her kinſwoman in perſon did at home, under her juriſdiction. But ambition, jealouſie, and revenge, at laſt got the victory over all her other vertues, by the malicious and crafty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of <hi>Minerva's</hi> enemies; who believed, they could not be ſafe as long as ſhe lived; ſince it was probable, if ever ſhe came to weare the Crown of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſhe would alwaies be mindfull of their diſaffections; theſe reaſons procured the Queen underhand, to ſigne a warrant for <hi>Minerva's</hi> death, which by the Lawes of the Countrey could not elſe be taken away by any power; and with this authority a meſſenger preſently was ſent to the chief officer of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to give <hi>Minerva</hi> warning of her approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching doom. When the ſad Princeſſe beheld this bloudy character written with the royall hand of her neereſt kinſwoman, it was a queſtion whether amazement or courage governed moſt in her noble thoughts; for as of one ſide ſhe could ſcarce believe, that the Queen had been drawne to an act ſo prejudiciall to the honour of her Sex, ſo of the other ſide, ſhe entertained the newes with a gentle ſmile, as a wiſhed period of all her miſeries, onely with three or foure deep ſighes, ſhe deſired theſe requeſts of thoſe commiſſioners
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98927:235"/>that had authority to ſee the ſentence put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Firſt, that ſhe might have all her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants about her at the time of her death, to beare true teſtimony to the world, that ſhe neither ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in her religion, nor derogated from her ſonnes honour: next that the Queen would be ſo charitable, as not onely quietly to ſuffer thoſe that attended about her perſon in ſafety to quit the Kingdome, but to pay them their due wages, if not reward them according to the juſt ſervice ſhe had received: and laſtly, that ſhe might have a Prieſt of her own profeſſion, to comfort and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct her in her laſt ſuffering. To the firſt, they onely anſwered, that as they could not give her leave to have all her attendants about her for feare of tumults, by reaſon of their multitudes, ſo were they willing to allow her ſome few to ſatisfie her deſire. For the ſecond, they promiſed to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to the Queen in her behalfe. But for the laſt, they abſolutely refuſed her requeſt, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it would be a diſhonour to the religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in <hi>Lydia.</hi> With theſe anſwers <hi>Minerva</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into her chamber, the better to prepare her religious thoughts againſt the next daies combate, where ſhe remained all that night with ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a zeale to the worſhip of the gods, and ſo cheerfull a demeanor in the perſwading of her ſervants to patience, by contemning of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſperity, that it was eaſily to be perceived, ſhe rather entertained death as a kind friend, that intended to put her in poſſeſſion of a better life, then as a fierce enemy that ſet before her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion frights of a horrid deſtruction; Thus ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:98927:235"/>her imployment, untill the early morning, and watchfull cruelty brought to her chamber doore the inſtruments of her deſtruction: This warning was ſufficient to make her prepare with Majeſty, to act the laſt ſcene that ſhould render her famous to poſterity. Wherefore with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant look, as if ſhe intended to laugh at deathes worſt ſhape, when ſhe came out ſhe bid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany good morrow, and then proceeded to the Scaffold with all the circumſtances belonging to her dignity, that was covered over with blacke Velvet; where being ſet in her diſmall Chaire of State, ſhe told the ſpectators, that as they muſt not expect many words from her, in regard her ſiſter the Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi> was not preſent, to whom ſhe would only have directed a diſcourſe; ſo of the other ſide, ſhe wiſht them all to beare witneſſe, that ſhe conſtantly expired in that religion ſhe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver profeſt to the world, for which ſhe both did, and was joyfull to ſhed her beſt bloud, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid, by one and one ſhe took leave of her ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who being over preſt with griefe and teares were ſcarce able to performe their laſt though conſtrained duties to fit their glorious Miſtreſſe for her execution; And with another ſweet ſmile holding up her white hands to the omnipotent gods for mercy, not long after without the leaſt unquiet motion, ſhe received that fatall ſtroake that ſent her ſoule to an eternall habitation.</p>
                  <p>When this unexampled Tragedy became ſpread over <hi>Aſia,</hi> which gave ſufficient occaſion of large diſcourſes, it could not but with ſpeedier wings flye to her Sons Court, with all the particular
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98927:236"/>circumſtances of her death, where it reſted untill an Ambaſſador from the Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi> was ſent in ſome ſort to leſſen the fact, as being abſolutely done without her privity, as he pretended, to which purpoſe ſome of her principall Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors had been puniſhed: but this Balſame a long time had not power to heale the deep wound this apprehended cruelty had made in his dutifull bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, untill his people finding that <hi>Myſſia</hi> was not able to contend with <hi>Lydia</hi> in any revenge, and that the ſmalleſt attempt offered by way of force to vindicate his honour, might interrupt his quiet and peaceable ſucceſſion to a Crowne ſo rich and flouriſhing, which ere long he could not be courſe of nature but expect, ſince the Queene was both old and decayed, not only diſſwaded him from any hoſtile evaſion, but alſo counſelled him to entertaine a firme correſpondency with the State, he was to poſſeſſe; and the rather, for that the <hi>Lydian</hi> meſſenger threamed him with a legall deprivation from his royall right, by the conſent of the whole Kingdome, by whoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as he ſaid, his mother had been condemned, if any way he ſtirred violently to diſturbe the peace eſtabliſht in both Countries.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reaſons I ſay render'd him as well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in ſhew as in effect, who was eſteemed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly peaceable if not ſlothfull in his nature; which was the occaſion, that as he could never be brought willingly to enter upon any actions of glory, ſo did it make him for the moſt part as it were a captive, to the preſſing importunities of his covetous, and inſolent Country men the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:98927:236"/>who ſcarce would be ſatisfied with any gaine or preferment whatſoever he could beſtow upon them: But to be ſhort, at laſt the old Queen of <hi>Lydia</hi> dying he without any contradiction, quickly took poſſeſſion of her Kingdoms, in which government he continued with all the proſperity in the world during his life; but that finiſhed, the Crownes of <hi>Lydia, Myſſia,</hi> and <hi>Creet,</hi> deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a juſt right upon his hopefull Son and Succeſſor <hi>Euarchus,</hi> then newly married to <hi>Hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinthia, Orſames</hi> ſiſter, our now Queen, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed alſo thoſe poſſeſſions (I muſt needs ſay) with as much happineſſe (until theſe laſt ſtirres) as it was poſſible for mortality to expect.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Myſſians</hi> who as I ſaid before received golden liberalities in the time of the old King, (he being a Prince that knew no way how to be provident) when they found that <hi>Euarchus</hi> nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous iſſue, and the Queenes neceſſary expences did in a manner drowne all their expectation; firſt, began to mutter in words againſt the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed vanities of the times; and laſtly they found fault that only ſmooth faced boys enjoyed, as they ſaid, all the credit of the Court, when Souldiers and men of valour wanted both coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and meanes to live, the King being ſo bewitched to his own eaſe, and his wives content, that he could not be drawne to helpe his own brother in law, againſt the oppreſſion of the King of <hi>Armenia;</hi> by which warre many might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed that now wanted ſubſiſtance: nor was there wanting in <hi>Lydia</hi> it ſelfe many factious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, that not only received encouragement by this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98927:237"/>bold language, who alſo coveted ſtate preferment in the government of the Common weale; yet theſe begun diſcontents lay hid in the cinders of ſome duty, untill new taxations of the Subjects gave more deſperate diſtaſtes; beſides, the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall arrivall of Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> in <hi>Lydia</hi> after his Fathers death, ſtirred up the pride of one <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogoras</hi> to a new ſpleen againſt the King, by which means he believed he ſhould be the ſooner imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But that which ſeemed moſt to contribute to <hi>Euarchus</hi> prejudice, was the ſudden arrivall of an old <hi>Myſſian</hi> Captaine out of the warres of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> called <hi>Lycius,</hi> who having gained in thoſe ſervices good ſtore of wealth, ſued to the King to have himſelfe rewarded by Titles of honour; which being denyed him by ſome neglect, as alſo <hi>Caſſianus</hi> requeſt for a competent aſſiſtance, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle protracted, this inſolent Commander quickly flew from the Court with execrations in his mouth, and malice in his heart; and comming into his own Countrey omitted no diligence that could withdraw the people from their lawfull obedience, which he had the better opportunity to effect, ſince he found not only the nobility am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, but the Prieſts violent. The one he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded with brave ſpirits againe to looke upon the courage of their Anceſtors, who had by force of Armes torne priviledges from their King; the other he admoniſhed to caſt their thoughts upon the recovery of that religion now almoſt loſt, that had formerly chaced their former Queen both from her Kingdome and life; and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people it was ſufficient to plead to their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98927:237"/>liberty; by whoſe perſwaſion the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity not only raiſed a power abſolutely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the Kings authority, in their own Country of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> but alſo led a great Army into <hi>Lydia,</hi> whereby to compell <hi>Euarchus</hi> to ſummon the great Councell of the Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, when this eminent aſſembly was met, as it was deſigned in the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> which was alſo aſſured to be made a free Towne (as much as to ſay, as not to be compelled to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to <hi>Euarchus</hi> and his poſterity) the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt diſcourſes that were made there, were in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of the Kings actions, and almoſt all the Acts that paſt were to deſtroy his authority: All which the milde King ſuffered with a world of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hoping that time, after they had wearied themſelves with their violent paſſions, would let them ſee their own miſtakes, or the gods at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would defend his innocency: however theſe unexpected proceedings not only continued, but their rage grew to ſuch a height againſt his perſon whereby as 'twas thought to bring him into the greater contempt amongſt the common people, that by divers tumults countenanced in the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he was at laſt forced from the City of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> whilſt the Senate in the interim inſtituted a ſtrong guard of Souldiers of the Towne Forces, to wait upon their Councels, becauſe they would ſhew to the Subjects, greater markes of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Aſſembly, then in the Kings dignity.</p>

                  <p>The Senate, who before had raiſed Forces to contend againſt the Kings intentions, according to the intelligence they had received not to be ſloathfull in their affaires, quickly created <hi>Dimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> generall in the deſigne, whom they knew was a man never to be reconciled to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, by reaſon of the ſpightfulneſſe of his own violent ambition; no ſooner was he eſtabliſht in his office, but he was commanded to march, as they pretended to ſeparate the King from perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Councels, and bring him ſafe to <hi>Sardis,</hi> there to be better governed; to which purpoſe that City had plentifully furniſhed money, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their proſperity depended upon their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ruine.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98927:247"/>unfortunately are rendred Subjects of miſery and chaſtizement, ſince none ever ſuffers without a cauſe: when revolutions happen (if we would but ſeriouſly enough looke after the reaſon) in the generall we ſhould find, matter ſufficient to convince our beliefe, that we are not totally inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent almoſt in any particular; when as the gods are oftentimes accuſtomed to preſerve the whole, for their ſakes, that may pretend juſtly to any thing extraordinary: No my friends, this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath been for ſome yeares paſt, involved in too much ſuperfluity, to expect long a continna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their felicity; which no doubt made us too unmindfull from whence proceeds originally all good and commodity: when peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity exceedingly abound in any region, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being at all bridled and reſtrained, by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary temperance and conſideration, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be expected ſoon after but captivity or deſtruction, to recall againe mens thoughts and actions to moderation, neceſſary for a new ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and preſervation: this world was created but as the tryer and touchſtone of our diſpoſitions for the better eſtabliſhment of our eternall conldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereafter, ſince otherwiſe certainly is had not been made at all: In this conſiſts the only mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of mankind; that we look at preſent as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall acquiſitions belonging properly to our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, without any relation to the future, when as they are I ſay intended either as accident all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits, or naturall conſolations, neceſſary in ſome ſort for our temporary ſubſiſtance: if we be great, mighty, and proſperous, we expect eaſe,

This conſideration makes me at preſent looke upon my ſelfe and you in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſery, with the ſame eyes of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration: wherefore being determined to call my own thoughts to a moſt ſtrict account, what I have acted, and how I may ſuffer; ſo would I have you alſo examine your conſciences, wherein you have offended, and in what nature you may be remedied; by this meanes, if it be yet poſſible to procure ſome mercy from the gods in our

                  <p>To be ſhort, within three daies time I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided all things neceſſary for the Kings journey: To this purpoſe he was clothed after the manner of the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſlaves, who are accuſtomed to be imployed about ſervile works in the field; onely he had over his under apparrell, a blew mantle with ſhort and large ſleeves: he wore upon his head a high bonnet in colour red, with three or four feathers taken from a cocks taile: upon his legs were faſmed certaine black buskins of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with buckles; betimes in the morning we iſſued out of the Town both on horſ-back, my ſervant riding before a great bag that was oyled all over to prevent the prejudice of raine, ſince I had put ſome neceſſary accommodation for

This ſmooth tale I had hoped would have freed me preſently; yet they kept us all that day and the next night, with a pretention the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall was not at leaſure, without whoſe diſcharge and allowance (as they ſaid) we could neither paſſe, or be at liberty: tis true, their chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to get money from us; but I muſt confeſſe I durſt not overbountifully offer them any, in regard it would have given the more occaſion of jealouſie and ſuſpition: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, notwithſtanding they ſeemed to detaine me as a priſoner, yet I got leave for my ſervant, to be in ſome ſort free in the camp, whereby to have the conveniency (as I pretended) to provide
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98927:250"/>ſome accommodation neceſſary for the horſes, who in that office performed his duty ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that I muſt tell you he was conſtrained all night to lie in the open field, without any coverture whatſoever over his body, though in truth it proved to be a very tempeſtuous ſeaſon: in this manner we were perplexed between feare and ſuffering, however I muſt confeſſe I little doubted the Kings diſcovery; not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his habit, but that he had alſo ſhaved his beard in a moſt antick faſhion. In concluſion the good humour of the Generall the next day, or rather the Souldiers finding there was but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be got from us, not onely diſcharged me from my further attendance, but gave a Paſſe for me and my ſervant to travell freely to the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> without any let or hindrance from any of their party; which proved to be of no ſmall conveniency unto us in all our journey; for although the protection onely mentioned that Town, where we leaſt intended to goe, yet as ſoon as I was out of the camp, I ſo finely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the writing with my own pen, that I made it moſt aptly ſerve for every place and region; in ſo much as by reaſon thereof in our journey, we were neither letted nor troubled to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, having a diſcharge preſently amongſt all manner of Officers of theirs, as ſoon as we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the paper, when as without doubt other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we had been infallibly taken and impriſoned, ſince thoſe parts where we travelled, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come extream ſuſpicious by order from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, in regard of the Declarations of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:98927:251"/>of purpoſe ſo commanded, the better as they thought to prevent all entercourſe and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency between the Kings party and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Nation.</p>
                  <p>In this manner at laſt we arrived in the <hi>Myſſian</hi> camp, and with a great ſatisfaction (I muſt needs ſay) to the Kings thoughts, however his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions were not preſently to diſcover his perſon; ſo that retiring into a little Village not very farre from the Army, he ſent me (after I had taken ſome ſmall refreſhment) to enquire for the <hi>Syrian</hi> Ambaſſadour, upon whoſe ſcore he rather ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have put his undertaking this dangerous adventure, then upon any abſolute confidence he could have in the <hi>Myſſians</hi> fidelity, in regard that they had already ſo often deceived him with their faire promiſes and falſe actions; it was my part, in complements to tell him as much, after I had made him acquainted with the Kings ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall. As the Ambaſſadour appeared ſomewhat amazed at the newes, ſo did he not ſtick to aſſure me, that he knew his Majeſty would be received by the Army with all honour and ſafety, and preſently went along with me to finde him out. The King after ſome few civilities, uſed this language to the Ambaſſador.</p>
                  <p>Sir, ſaid he, as you now ſee me in a poſture far below my birth and dignity, ſo the gods, to let us know we are but men, have for the preſent ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my perſon according to my misfortunes, whereby to comply the better with my neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; this I hope is ſufficient to ſhew what a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire I have to put my ſelfe into the hands of my
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98927:251"/>native Countreymen: if either the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my paſt benefits, beſtowed upon them in the generall, or any compaſſionate reflection upon my unfortunate ſtate, at the inſtant are motives ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to work upon humanity, I ſhall be ſafe here, and may be proſperous hereafter; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I would not have them to worke upon my miſeries for poor and contemptible gaine, ſo ſhall not I remember them any more of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ingratitude and diſobedience: but rather let us both unite in ſuch a conſtant conjunction, that as by their means I may come againe to be King, ſo will they ever by ſuch an act of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe oblige me to govern for their benefit: they cannot but conſider with what little probability they can hope for any eſtabliſhment in <hi>Lydia,</hi> but by my means, when as already the Senate doth not onely diſvalue their actions and proceedings by moſt diſgracefull and contemptible ſpeeches, but now that they have brought (as they believe) their affaires to a proſperous iſſue (whereby they have no more need of their aſſiſtance, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently would be rid of the trouble) they not onely diſpute with them the Titles and reaſons of their own intereſt, but even deny them the payment of their juſt due, for all thoſe ſervices they have performed for their advantages in <hi>Lydia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Ambaſſadour did not make any great reply to the Kings diſcourſe, but in a few com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements, concerning his own ſervices, ſo did he preſently conduct him to his houſe for his better accommodation; where he gave preſent order
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98927:252"/>to have him furniſhed with apparell and other neceſſaries, whilſt in the interim (as it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed) he acquainted <hi>Lycius</hi> the Generall, and the reſt of the Officers of the Army, with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival in the camp: After two or three daies time the Ambaſſadour not onely expoſed the King to the view of the people, but delivered him into the protection of the ſouldiers; where however <hi>Lycius</hi> and ſome of the principall of the Nobility, entertained his preſent with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary outward humility; yet nevertheleſſe with certain kind of ſad and diſtruſtfull looks and countenances, they performed their duties and reſpects in kiſſing his hands, and uſing other ceremonies, as if they were not any way privy, much leſſe conſenting to his journey; the King, notwithſtanding he ſeemed not to take any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their actions in publique, but of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary gave teſtimonies of joy and gladneſſe, at the apprehenſion of his happy fortune; yet in private, by many words and ſighes, he expreſſed his own doubts, and opinion concerning his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture entertainment; the rather, in regard they preſently ſet a ſtrict gard upon his perſon, though pretending it to be done for no other end but for his greater honour and ſafty: however his hopes became ſomething better ſatisfied, for that they admitted freely to his converſations, not onely many of his houſhold ſervants that were come from <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> after the Town was ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to <hi>Farezius,</hi> but ſome of thoſe Prieſts alſo of his owne faction, that were under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the <hi>Flamins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:98927:252"/>
                  <p>In this manner the King remained for divers weeks, delighting his thoughts with ſuch recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as had been almoſt made cuſtomary to his nature, by continuall practice from his infancy, which made not a few wonder, how he could ſeem pleaſed with ſuch triviall things in the height of his vexations and diſcontents. Again, it was ſpightfully laid to his charge by his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that he had no great prejudice in being tumbled from his throne, when as he appeared not to have apprehention enough to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible, of what conſequence the loſſe of a kingdome was: but probably either he had ſo much wiſdome, as to reflect upon the uncertainty of all worldly things with a right conſideration, or was endued with ſuch a ſupream goodneſſe in his diſpoſition, as perſwaded him to beare his afflictions with no ordinary temper and paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>In the interim the <hi>Myſſians</hi> were not idle, to play their game to the beſt advantage, both with the Senate and the King: for as of one ſide they made the Senate believe, they had a mind to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Kings injuries and ſufferings, both out of honour and Religion; ſo did they alwaies tell the King, that he muſt give ſatisfaction to the demands of either Kingdome, before they could become inſtrumentall in his eſtabliſhment; which drew on their conſultations to the length of many weeks expectation, the Senate urging the delivering of the Kings perſon into their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, out of right and juſtice, in regard they had been onely hired in the warns and ſervice of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98927:253"/>
                     <hi>Lydia,</hi> by their money; ſo that conſequently they were obliged with a punctuall decorum to obſerve their commands in every thing: of the other ſide <hi>Euarchus</hi> party affirmed; that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> as well as <hi>Lydia,</hi> the <hi>Myſſians</hi> ought to have as particular an intereſt in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and preſervation, as the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> in proſecution of which, they were to ſee him again reſtored to his Crown and dignity, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any deſire to the contrary: but whilſt theſe diſputations laſted, as I may ſay, with ſome ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bitterneſſe of either ſide, which as 'twas thought, would inſtantly have cauſed a cruell and bloudy warre between both Nations, one <hi>Argilius</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Myſſia</hi> came ſuddenly from his own Countrey into the Campe, who from the very beginning of the ſtirs had been a main oppoſer (by reaſon of his own covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ambition) of the Kings intereſt in that Nation: intending thereby more abſolutely to govern all the affaires of that kingdome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: when he arrived he preſently went to the counſell of the Army, where he made this oration unto them.</p>
                  <p>Gentlemen ſaid he, I underſtand you are now aſſembled about theſe conſultations, that may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Kings particular concernments; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeding from the earneſt ſolicitation of the <hi>Syrian</hi> Ambaſſador: and partly in regard <hi>Euarchus</hi> is now preſent amongſt you in the Camp: In my opinion it is more juſt and convenient, in the firſt place to look upon the gods worſhip: in the next to mind our own preſervations: to this purpoſe in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98927:253"/>my judgement it ought to be conſidered, why we took up Armes at all in the beginning to oppoſe our Prince, if now without any other condition whatſoever we ſhould lay them downe, and againe reſtore him to his ancient dignity without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions? I pray, remember we have made a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne proteſtation to the gods, as of the other ſide a confederation with our friends: and if we breake with both, no doubt but heaven and earth will accuſe us as well of perjury as indiſcretion; ſince we ſhould ſeem, neither to reverence ſacred things as we are bound, nor preſerve humane ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations as we ought: may you not remember, we took from our King his power for no other reaſon, but becauſe we thought him not fit to raigne over us, accompanied with his ſtubborne and wilfull crimes; and ſhall we preſently reſtore him to that State againe without amendment? are we not tyed by promiſes to the Senate of <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> faithfully to performe their buſineſſes in theſe Warres, whilſt we are under their pay and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction? and ſhall we detaine the very object of their intentions againſt their minds, as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected perſon by our Army, who was the onely booty they aymed at to purchaſe by our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours? O horrid injuſtice and more pernitious indiſcretion, ſince in the one undoubtedly we exaſperate the gods anger, as in the other we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly endanger our own ſafeties; for as they cannot but revenge, their own diſhonour in the higheſt fury of their wrath, in regard of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, ſo juſtly may the people of <hi>Lydia</hi> over-run our Kingdom, for not performing thoſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98927:254"/>we contracted for, before we entered their Countrey; which however may be a Warre of ſome long contention and diſpute; yet the effects muſt needs be bloudy and expencefull; whereas, if we go hand in hand with our friends, (I meane the great Senate at <hi>Sardis</hi>) we ſhall not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch an amity, as probably will make both Nations happy, but for the preſent fill our coffers with ſufficient gold, to render us in <hi>Myſſia,</hi> equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich with other Countries of <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By releaſing the King I ſay without their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, we give him only power and conveniency, inſtead of being gratefull for the benefit, to puniſh us for having been at the firſt the chief occaſion, that made him at all ſtand in need of ſuch a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: This diſpoſition of his hath bin ſufficiently experimented in his neceſſities, when as he wil not ſo farre gratifie us as to put the <hi>Flamins</hi> out of the Temples: Theſe reaſons being conſidered I ſay, let us preſently diſpatch meſſengers to the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> with full power and commiſſion from this Army, not only to Treat of conditions, but to conclude with that Councell, concerning thoſe conditions and Articles which ſhall be thought fit to be offered to the King to confirme, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be reſtored to his Crowne, or releaſed from his impriſonment: ſo ſhall we be pious to the gods, juſt to our friends, and beneficiall to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Although there was much contradiction, and ſtrong diſputes concerning this oration of <hi>Argi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> yet in regard <hi>Lycius</hi> the generall, with many others of his faction in the Councell, were againſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98927:254"/>the Kings deſires; An abſolute determination was preſently there taken, to ſend <hi>Argilius</hi> with ſome other Commiſſioners to the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> whereby to conclude ſuch propoſitions, as ſhould be held moſt advantagable as they ſaid for both Nations; Though it was well knowne the <hi>Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> had only an intention to good themſelves; not only in the payment of that money, which they expected from the Senate, but in regard of their ſecret intentions by <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſuppreſſion, to have an equall ſhare in the government of the Kingdom of <hi>Lydia:</hi> but however they concluded, to put in execution their reſolutions with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, yet they ſtill kept the King in hopes by faire promiſes of his reſtoration, as well to couzen and deceive his expectation, that he might not entertaine new thoughts, or fall upon other Counſels, as that he might not be irreconcilably diſtaſted with their actions, if they ſhould miſſe of their agreement with the Senate of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who they doubted might be ſomething unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, to part with thoſe vaſt ſummes that were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; which ſayling, they intended to make uſe both of the Kings Titles and countenance, to proſecute their other deſignes, either in <hi>Lydia</hi> it ſelfe or any other part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> as there ſhould be occaſion.</p>
                  <p>The propoſitions they offered to the Senate were theſe: Firſt, that the ſolemne proteſtation formerly agreed upon ſhould be taken by every perſon of both Nations without exception, out of which not the King himſelfe to be exempted: ſecondly not onely the juriſdiction but the very
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98927:255"/>name of the <hi>Flamins</hi> to be abſolutely aboliſhed, and no other rights and manner of worſhip of the gods, to be uſed but according to the cuſtomes of <hi>Myſſia:</hi> Thirdly, that both <hi>Euarchus</hi> and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſo farre to be diſinabled in their authority, that each Senate in both Kingdomes might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confident of their power, whereby to be freed in their own opinions from all danger and ſuſpition in the future: Fourthly, that ſuch ſums of money ſhould ſpeedily be payed to the <hi>Myſſians</hi> as was promiſed for their ſatisfaction; and Laſtly, Commiſſioners to be choſen out of either Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to whom the common tranſaction of affairs ſhould be equally committed.</p>
                  <p>Although theſe two latter Articles were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſputed, yet it was not long before it was agreed, that theſe conditions being preſented and the King refuſing to ſubſcribe them, he ſhould be detained as a priſoner, and not acknowledged for a Prince: <hi>Argylius</hi> and the reſt returning to the Campe, (where the King to be ſhort refuſing his ſubſcription and conſent) within a very few weeks, imployed for the circumſtances neceſſarily belonging to every performance, <hi>Euarchus</hi> was by the conduction of ſome Troopes of horſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the cuſtody of <hi>Farezius,</hi> who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conveyed him with his own Souldiers, to a faire houſe formerly belonging to the Kings of <hi>Lydia:</hi> Of the other ſide, both <hi>Argylius</hi> and <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> marched into their own Countrey of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> with money and triumph, as if they had deſerved immortall fame, for their diſloyalty, which for the preſent muſt end my dolefull ſtory, ſince the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98927:255"/>time of the day envites us to take part of a ſlender ſupper, according to the warning of the little Bell I heare: however before you goe to bed, I engage my ſelfe, to furniſh you with another rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much more pleaſing to my thoughts, that occaſioned the late meeting of the people in the Fields, with ſuch expreſſions of joy as you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held: ſo taking <hi>Narciſſus</hi> by the hand, he led him into a pretty roome, where they found two or three diſhes of meat newly ſet upon the Table, attended onely by the old woman and the youth. After they had given thankes to the gods, within an hours ſpace they ended their ſupper; the cloth being preſently taken away, and ſome few other diſcourſes of delight fitteſt for digeſtion paſt over, the Prieſt againe began this new relation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſaid he, being thus entered as I told you into a new captivity (though farre more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly uſed) was conſtrained to attend the comming of the commiſſioners of the <hi>Myſſians</hi> to <hi>Sardis,</hi> for the further diſpoſure of his perſon and affaires: but in the interim the Souldiers, whether contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their cuſtome and vocation, reflecting prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally upon the miſeries and afflictions of the King, or rather being willing to make that the ground or pretentions for their future intentions, to quarrell with the Senate, about their owne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, in ſeeing the <hi>Myſſians</hi> eſteemed and themſelves neglected, not onely by degrees began to uſe the King gently, but openly to complaine, that themſelves were ſo farre from receiving re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for their ſervices, as that they had not been juſtly paid their wages: when as the <hi>Myſſians</hi> as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98927:256"/>they ſaid, received great ſummes of money, for doing nothing elſe but running away, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying their King: alſo they ſeemed exaſperated, to have them countenanced in ſetting up their manner of worſhip of the gods, throughout all the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to the enſlaving as was urged of the Nation in the free liberty of their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; when as the people according as had bin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them, could not exerciſe their own manner of worſhip: beſides they ſeemed extreamly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine that <hi>Myſſian</hi> governours ſhould be joyned with thoſe of <hi>Lydia</hi> it ſelfe, in the management of State affaires, that belonged properly onely to the Nation: neither did theſe diſcontented diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes end in this manner; for they daily aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in private Counſels, to produce ſomething for their advantages, though they yet knew not very well what either to demand or act: however theſe proceedings were ſoone brought to the knowledge of the Senate, who being jealous alſo of their own intentions, were a great deale the more fearfull of any dangerous accidents; ſo that preſently, they ſent meſſengers to the Army, though as 'twas ſaid with intentions to perſwade, yet with authority to command the Souldiers to a better obedience: but as theſe officers were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely deceived in their expectations, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their own power and intereſt in the Campe, ſo were they forced with expedition to returne to thoſe that ſent them, with ſome terrour in their countenances; As this for many dayes, cauſed ſometimes diſtracted Counſels, otherwhiles more peremptory diſcourſes, ſo was it not over long
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98927:256"/>before the Senate, was ſaluted with a declaration from the Souldiers, wherein they not onely taxed them, with want of juſtice and extreame ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Army, that had fought ſo many Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, and ſhed ſo much bloud for themſelves and the priviledges of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but alſo preſented their conſiderations with theſe following propoſals, wherein they wiſht to be ſpeedily ſatisfied: firſt, that they might with all expedition not onely be paid their juſt dues, but in a convenient time be farther rewarded according to their deſerts: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that no part of the Army ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded without their owne conſents: Thirdly, that ſuch lawes and decrees might preſently be eſtabliſhed, to aſſure the people of <hi>Lydia</hi> of their convenient liberties; and Laſtly, that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the gods according to the <hi>Myſſian</hi> rights, might not be impoſed abſolutely upon any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or condition: Theſe demands being ſent to the Senate by meſſengers of their own, that before never expected to be contradicted, much leſſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed by any power whatſoever, began to thinke, that it would be now their ſafeſt way, rather for the preſent to endeavour to temper the Souldiers paſſions, then further either to tempt or hazzard their fury; To this purpoſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back their meſſengers, with faithfull or at leaſtwiſe fained promiſes, that ſpeedily they ſhould receive ſatisfaction, according to their hearts content: Nevertheleſſe the Army finding after ſome weekes expectation, that the Senate endeavoured, rather to deceive their expectations by ſowing underhand and private factions among
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98927:257"/>the Souldiers, then that they intended really to performe in effect, any thing that was actually for their good, after they had as it were choſen <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezius</hi> as their Captaine Generall for their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as well as the Senate had choſen him for the Warres, not only ſeized preſently upon moſt of the Magazins of the Kingdome, but alſo ſent ſome Troopes to take the King out of priſon where he remained: <hi>Euarchus</hi> being a little ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at this new and ſudden attempt, as he could not well interpret their meaning, although 'tis probable he might like well enough of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo at the firſt, did he make ſome ſtand at their proceedings; yet at laſt being perſwaded of their faire intentions, and having of the other ſide aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them of his affection, they inſtantly carried him in a certaine kinde of triumph through moſt part of the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> untill at laſt they lodged him in a brave Caſtle of his own, where he now remaines (as it is believed) with a great deale of ſatisfaction; And the rather, for that (it being ſo given out) they doe not only in an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable manner, ſuffer him to exerciſe his own rights concerning the worſhip of the gods, with a free admittance of all companies to be entertal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with what converſation he pleaſeth, but have lately envited him to ſend for the Queene and all his children, who ſhall be as they ſay joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full witneſſes of his being againe eſtabliſhed in his Throne and dignity: and however they be ſomething ſuſpitious of the practiſes of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> and thoſe belonging to that faction, leaſt they might perſwade the Kings heart
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98927:257"/>from the intereſt of the Souldiers, yet the better to give him ſatisfaction, concerning the opinion of his own liberty; neither they or any elſe are debarred either from his preſence or communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whilſt of every ſide they have promiſed the common people a happineſſe according to their expectations, both in their manner of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the gods, as well as belonging to all other priviledges, that can poſſibly any way appertaine unto their future condition: which in truth I muſt tell you was the only occaſion of our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this day; Not only to thanke the gods in the generall for this appearing happy change, but alſo a little to exerciſe their ancient decorums in their rurall ſports, in regard they had been for ſome time debarred from ſuch ſports, by the rigid ſeverity of the <hi>Myſſian</hi> cuſtomes; which as I told you have been brought into <hi>Lydia,</hi> by the Prieſts and others of that Nation, that at laſt was impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the people, as an abſolute injunction by the authority of the Senate: This being what I can ſay for your ſatisfaction, concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affaires of the Kingdome, wherein I feare me I have too much offended in the generall by my long diſcourſes, though upon the matter I do not ſee how they could have been well omitted in any particular, ſo I hope you will now give me leave to end. After that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> had thanked him for the paines he had taken, and the favour himſelfe had received, (having paſt away ſome time longer in other diſcourſes upon the ſame ſubject) the Prieſt calling his boy to take the lights, he conducted <hi>Narciſſus</hi> into his chamber,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98927:258"/>where after a while, with ſome Court-comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he left him to take his reſt, promiſing in the morning to ſhew him the Liberary, as one of the beſt curioſities he could preſent him withall.</p>
                  <p>It was not very early the next morning, that the Prieſt interrupted <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> conceiving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that his travell required ſomething more then ordinary reſt, though in that he was much deceived; for he was not accuſtomed to let paſſe much time, without thinking upon his deere <hi>Cloria:</hi> when he came into his chamber, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited him, according to his promiſe to the ſight of his Library. As in that place they turned over many books of divers kinds, ſo beholding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, Maps and Spheares of the world, they fell in divers diſcourſes concerning the opinions of ſome in the Primitive age, that did not believe there were any <hi>Antipodes;</hi> as alſo, others again, that thought the Sunne ſtood ſtill, and the earth turned round; beſides, a third ſort of people which would not believe, but that there was another world in the Moon. This gave occaſion to the old Prieſt to ſay, that as he would not much trouble his thoughts with the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe queſtions, ſince it could no way concerne either his preſent or future being, ſo was it an unanſwerable argument for the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoule, that the Sun being of ſo vaſt a greatneſſe, &amp; of ſo excellent a clarity, no way to be know or imagined, of what matter it was made of, could not in all reaſon but be created for a thing more worthy then it ſelf; &amp; that not appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98927:258"/>in this world, of neceſſity it muſt be the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoul of man, and nothing elſe, which was at firſt ordained to be the object of ſuch an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard that onely remaining here, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to eternity, and ſo conſequently more worthy then all other things. From this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, they fell to a diſputation about the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of Armes and Learning, which of both ought to have the greater prerogative in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eſteem: <hi>Narciſſus</hi> ſaid, that as action was more Noble then contemplation, ſince the one did but think what the other performed; ſo in probability arms was to be preferred before let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in that it created really the ſubject for the others imployment: beſides, he ſaid that action did not onely nouriſh it ſelfe, but gave life to other things, as namely Hiſtory, the worlds looking-glaſſe, and times recorder: againe, the undergoing of dangers and difficulties, as he ſaid, was a means to warme mens apprehenſions, and deſires with Noble flames; whilſt Learning, in a more obſcure way, did but hold it the beſt honour it could merit from poſterity, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber truly what other people did worthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation; however perhaps it ſelfe was onely contented to lie drowned in a certain kind of ſenſuality, pleaſed with an imagination, that coveted but to know tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98927:259"/>and enjoyed, but by active valour; when as books did no otherwiſe then make relation of thoſe paſſages, like Generals in triumphant Chariots after the battel, ſhewing to the people what was deſerved in the field; or rather repreſenting an excellent Comedian, appareld in moſt glorious attire, that playes to the life without wounds, the part of him that acted nobly and dangerouſly againſt his enemy. Books I muſt confeſſe, ſaid he, are commodious pictures, to teach preſent times by predeceſſors examples, what men ought to doe in their own perſons; whereas by activity and armes, we are put in poſſeſſion of the honour it ſelfe: The one, as I may ſay, being onely the ſhadow, that may in ſome ſort ſatisfie a ſoule not ſufficiently knowing or inflamed; like old people that repeat with delight their old ſtories in their youth, when they have no more power or will to act to any purpoſe: whereas the other continues us enjoying our own vertues, like a plentifull and flouriſhing Harveſt, producing variety of new fruit to the induſtrious Husbandman. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaid, that Letters were onely uſefull in ſeaſons of quiet, whereas armes could onely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and protect-learning at all times, to make it become profitable, for that mens unruly and prepoſterous courſes, and actions were to be reſtrained and regulated, more by power then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivaſion. This being ſaid, <hi>Narciſſus</hi> with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſmile, gave the Prieſt alſo occaſion to ſhew his reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The Prieſt told him, as he hoped without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence he would give him leave to be of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:98927:259"/>opinion, however he honoured ſufficiently the profeſſion of armes, ſo with a courteous ſmile he began the queſtion alſo in this manner: although I will not deny, ſaid he, but my ſelfe to have been a ſouldier in my youth, yet I cannot but ſtand for the priviledge of the pen, according to reaſon and juſtice; wherefore as contemplation doth not deſtroy the exerciſe of the body, ſo of the other ſide, books render a man more capable to act with advantage, without which attempts would not be much profitable, ſince mans life is too little a ſpace to learne ſufficiently, what were beſt to be done in many things: he ſaid further, that Military diſcipline it ſelfe, could not ſubſiſt to any prevailing purpoſe, without thoſe rules and orders which were before thought upon, and learned by method and inſtruction; for that it is not onely the running precipitately into haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and dangers, that ought to render a perſon deſervedly admired, though ſometimes blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold fortune, crowne the action or attempt with ſucceſſe; but rather when as by a knowing va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, we have either prevented a miſchiefe or procured a victory, deſerves eſtimation: A pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and valiant Generall, ſaid he, goeth not ſo much into the field to hazzard and deſtroy, as to preſerve and overcome; which certainly cannot be ſo well effected, as by leaſt ſlaughter, and moſt policy; or although Monarchies and Countries are oftentimes conquered by force of armes and power, yet ſeldome without ſtratagems and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can they be long &amp; quietly enjoyed, for want of good eſtabliſhed lawes to maintaine them in

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:98927:265"/>Priſon into the Souldiers protection: as this gave all our thoughts, freſh hopes of ſomething ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to be acted for his good and reſtoration, ſo am I at preſent ſent to him with Letters from the Queen, though to what effectuall purpoſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, for that I find not only her ſelfe, but the whole State of <hi>Syria</hi> to be extreamely addicted to the <hi>Myſſian</hi> intereſt, which as I ſuppoſe the Army will never willingly conſent unto, in regard they have already ſo publickly and violently declared to the contrary; having made it the chiefe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the quarrell between them and the Senate, which in effect is all I can ſay either of my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or imployment: Then turning himſelfe to the Prieſt he told him, that he muſt intreat his company to Court: and this preſently carried them all three to ſupper.</p>
                  <p>When they had ended, the Prieſt told <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> that although he feared his occaſions would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him for the preſent to take a journey to Court, whereby to have the happineſſe againe to ſee his old maſter the King, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence not to be longer in a capacity, to doe him that farther ſervice in his own houſe he deſired, yet he hoped they ſhould have the honour of his company along with them, where he durſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his reception ſhould be equall with either of theirs, in thoſe contents they ſhould receive by ſo fortunate an occaſion.</p>

                     <hi>Narciſſus</hi> after he had thanked him, as well for his paſt favours as his preſent offers, aſſured him that as he could not but be extreamely joyfull at the opportunity he ſhould have by that voyage,

                  <p>When <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was come into his chamber, and being there onely accompanied by his ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts, inſtead of ſleep he fell upon theſe melancholly conſiderations: Firſt it came into his minde, that he had not alone loft a deare and loving father, whoſe wiſedome would have been a continuall ſupport unto him in all his difficult affaires, but by that unreparable loſſe, he was alſo in danger to be deprived of the beſt part of his eſteemed hereditary honour, and command, by the marriage of his ſiſter with <hi>Eumenes,</hi> ſince in his roome he was elected chiefe governour of the

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:98927:267"/>to endure all aſſaults and affronts to that purpoſe, that ſhould from time to time be attempted upon her perſon: As theſe laſt conſiderations moſt ſtrugled inwardly with his uncertaine thoughts, not knowing well whether he ſhould leave <hi>Lydia</hi> or not, ſo did he begin to thinke, that there being no Army in the Field that was in action, and not knowing how to be admitted to <hi>Clorias</hi> preſence, it would be too little purpoſe longer to continue in the Kingdome; and therefore reſolved pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to goe for <hi>Cyprus;</hi> where he ſeemed not to doubt, but that the people (if not <hi>Eumenes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe) finding him alive contrary to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would ſoon be perſwaded to reaſon in his behalfe: And to this purpoſe being ſetled in his fathers command, he ſhould be not only able to bring aſſiſtance to King <hi>Euarchus</hi> occaſions, but alſo contribute much to his dangers releaſement; whereas the contrary would both confirme the opinion of his being dead, and in ſome ſort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe himſelfe of too much ſloath in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for not appearing activer in thoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his own that belonged ſo exceedingly to his honour and welfare: with theſe reſolutions h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:98927:268"/>probably they can never be brought, to be hearty in the Kings affaires, ſince not only in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe times they oppoſed his authority, with all the craft and violence they could poſſibly uſe, but at laſt as I may ſay delivered him betrayed and bound hand and foot, into the hands of thoſe that were eſteemed by himſelfe his greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, when as he had choſen for his protection, rather the <hi>Myſſian</hi> Army then the Senate of <hi>Lydia:</hi> And this expreſſion of ill nature and treachery, was only to obtaine the payment of a ſmall ſum of money, not to be valewed in regard of a Kings ranſome: ſo that I ſay it may be ſuppoſed, they have ſome other hidden myſtery in their thoughts againſt his proſperity, which perhaps the State of <hi>Syria</hi> wil never be able ſufficiently to underſtand, whilſt it be too late to repaire the Kings loſſes onely procured by thoſe people: for it is well knowne, during the time they gave <hi>Euarchus</hi> the beſt hopes concerning their affections and fidelity, they were then by their falſe inſtruments, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting with the Senate for his ſpeedy impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; a plaine demonſtration of their harſh and cruell intentions towards his particular; for that when they moſt betrayed him, they profeſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves then his faithfulleſt ſervants; as it were ſmothering him in a bed of roſes, and killing him with deceitfull language: whereas of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, theſe Souldiers that have not onely the Kings perſon, but his authority under their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; and ſo by conſequence may either ſhorten his life or preſerve his dignity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they have heretofore alwayes declared
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:98927:269"/>themſelves mortall enemies to his intereſt, and proceedings, as never having any dependency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Court or his affaires, yet now appeare to the outward view of the world, to be his greateſt friends, either being converted and altered in their opinions, or more compaſſionate and juſt in their diſpoſitions: which certainly cannot but extreamely augment the Kings obligations, if they performe any thing remarkable according to their profeſſions; but as I will not trouble you with my thoughts, what may be the iſſue of their intentions or actions, ſo muſt I a little diſcourſe unto you, what may be the ſuppoſitions of the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> State, that ſeemes ſo much to countenance the <hi>Myſſians</hi> before the Souldiers; and to ſay the plaine truth doe more favour them then any other people, that have ſeemed moſt affectionate towards the Kings intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Firſt you may ſuppoſe, that they thinke the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> not onely in regard that moſt of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Nobility, have either command or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in the Army or Warres of <hi>Syria,</hi> but the common people and inferiour ſort, have ſuch a dependency upon the Nation, by reaſon of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine priviledges granted them time out of mind, by way of a free Trade and commerce amongſt them, that it is unpoſſible for them to quit their intereſt, for any other benefit that can be propoſed to their conſideration: And the rather for that the Court maintaines alwayes ſome Ambaſſadour or Agent in their Countrey, both to direct their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and deſignes, and to inform the State upon all occaſions of their proceedings; which joyned
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:98927:269"/>with the large pentions are beſtowed amongſt their rulers, and other eminent perſons of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> will prove as they believe neceſſary ties and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to retaine their fidelities conſtant to the <hi>Syrian</hi> ends; And ſo conſequently can they never attempt the deſtroying or leſſening of Monarchy, but as they ſhall direct and approve of: beſides moſt of the factions now prevailing againſt <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> authority in <hi>Myſſia,</hi> are compoſed either of Lords or Prieſts, who are moſt commonly not ſo envious to royalty (or at leaſtwiſe as they may believe more to be perſwaded by reaſon) then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant people, that have learned no rules ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to government and order, by any manner of fitting education; wherefore not ſo much to be feared in their courſes and prevailing juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they ſhould be ſuffered ſomething too much to proſper in either proceedings againſt their King: Secondly, it cannot be doubted, but that Monarchy in the generall, is a great deale more conducing to the commodity of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> then a common government, either in <hi>Lydia</hi> or <hi>Myſſia;</hi> and therefore not probable they ſhould joyne in ſuch a ſtrict amity with the Senate, as abſolutely to deſtroy the prerogative, and Kingly juriſdiction of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> ſince by that conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they would neither be able to temper their own factions at home, amongſt the Nobility and perſons of greateſt quality, nor have any hope to receive benefit from other Princes abroad in their occaſions: and whereas many may be perſwaded to believe, that by agreeing in thoſe deſignes, for the abſolute overthrowing of Monarchy in <hi>Lydia,</hi>
                     <pb n="198" facs="tcp:98927:270"/>they might in time come to be equall ſharers in the government of both Kingdomes; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently participate alike in the profit and gain, being the chiefe (if not the onely) thing their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous diſpoſitions looke after, ſuch thoughts are meere fancies and chymeras: for certainly the Senate underſtanding well the poorneſſe of the Country of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> and not being ignorant of the ſecret intentions of the people, withall how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting and encroaching they are in their natures; will be ſure to take order, they ſhall have no more intereſt in the affaires of <hi>Lydia,</hi> then is intirely neceſſary for their own ſervice and commodity: ſo that when the <hi>Myſſians</hi> ſhall find their aymes to faile in theſe particulars, it is to be imagined that they will not onely be perſwaded, upon the leaſt endeavour of the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> to fall off from the <hi>Lydian</hi> faction, but even to make a War with that Nation it ſelfe, for the eſtabliſhing againe of their King in his ancient glory and command; and to that effect adhere either to <hi>Syria</hi> or any other Nation that may aſſiſt them in thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: onely this doubt in ſome ſort may be made, that <hi>Argilius</hi> and <hi>Lycius,</hi> who ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily have betrayed the Kings perſon for a ſum of money, will never by their good wills truſt themſelves any more under his power, for feare of revenge anſwerable to their deſerts; And they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt principall men of the Countrey, it is to be ſuſpected, they will have ſo great power and influence, over the actions and determinations of the reſt of the Inhabitans in the generall, that they can never be brought in any kind to own the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:98927:270"/>Kings intereſt to purpoſe, notwithſtanding all the labour and induſtry of the Kingdome of <hi>Syria:</hi> But to this I ſhall only make this anſwer, that however theſe people prevailed in the <hi>Myſſian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for the ſelling of the Kings perſon, againſt the thoughts and wills of many, yet that very action of theirs, hath procured them ſince ſo much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in their own Country, that it may very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be believed by the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> there muſt of neceſſity ariſe daily new factions amongſt them, neither want they intelligence at the preſent, that aſſures them that an Army will ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly march into <hi>Lydia</hi> from <hi>Myſſia,</hi> in King <hi>Euarchus</hi> behalf: which advertizement I ſuppoſe is ſent, them by their Ambaſſadour there remaining: Laſt of all I may adde that the Court of <hi>Syria</hi> may imagine, the Souldiers who have now the King in their poſſeſſion, having no other relation but to their own wills and uncertaine principles, will prove from time to time as inconſtant in their reſolutions, as they have been heretofore deſperate in their fortunes, and be rather in the generall inclinable to affect equality, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long contented to be governed by Kingly authority, or to ſay the plaine truth willing to be under any juriſdiction whatſoever; witneſſe their falling off from their command both under the Senate and their old Generall: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides it is eſteemed a maxime among their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, to have ſcarce dependency upon any power, neither in thoſe things that belong to the gods worſhip, or concerning other their humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pretending by ſuch conſtraint, an abſolute

                  <p>At night they tooke up their lodging; not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove halfe a dayes journey where the King remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and not much farther diſtant from the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> where encountering with a jovial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion maſter of the houſe, as appearing alſo faithfull to <hi>Euarchus</hi> in his intentions, after they had accommodated themſelves to their minds in their chambers, they deſired their hoſt with an equall indifference to let them underſtand, as well the newes that concerned the proceedings of the Senate, as that which belonged more properly to the Army, ſince as they ſaid, they could not chuſe, but be of a nature ſomething more remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable then ordinary, in regard of the late tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of both parties, which ſeemed at preſent to put moſt of the Kingdome to a kind of a vaſt conſideration concerning the iſſue: the rather were they curious of this information, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:98927:272"/>thereby to taſt the inclinations of the people.</p>
                  <p>Truly gentlemen, ſaid the Hoſt, as I muſt not take upon me the underſtanding of either of their proceedings and determinations, when as perhaps they are not very well acquainted with their own intentions themſelves, ſo ſhall I to ſupply that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect enforme you if you pleaſe, of thoſe diſcourſes that have lately paſſed in the Senate, concerning the Kings government, notwithſtanding the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have him perſonally at the preſent under their juriſdiction; who to ſay the plaine truth, uſe him with that civility and reſpect, that it gives his friends more then ordinary hopes, of his ſpeedy reſtoration againe to the honour of his Crowns and Dignity; however the gods onely know what the iſſue of their determinations may be: ſome of the Senate would have no King at all, pretending that it would be too miſerable a condition for all ſorts of people, to be Subject both in their perſons and eſtates to an entire Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, not ſuffering them ſo much as to aske a reaſon concerning any thing that ſhould be done amiſſe, although their purſes and paines were forced, upon all occaſions to pay for the honour, and the pride belonging to the dignity: whereas a common government as they ſay, gives a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine kinde of encouragement pleaſing, in ſome kinde or other to all ſorts of people, as having an appropriated ſhare in every action, that concerned the good or ill of the Commonwealth: others againe of a contrary ſpirit pretended, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that if the government ſhould be abſolutely changed to a popular State, though it might
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:98927:273"/>ſeem in outward appearance, to have more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it could not nevertheleſſe but be of leſſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, in that it would be alwayes Subject to faction and confuſions, in regard of the inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of diſpoſitions, and therefore are rather of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the government remaine in the ſame nature as it doth, with ſome neceſſary reſtrictions to their King: A third ſort made ſome doubt, how to finde out wayes to limite a Monarch in any kinde, by what lawes ſoever could be eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to that purpoſe, it being almoſt impoſſible to take from a Prince altogether the ſword of Juſtice &amp; power, and yet ſuffer him ſtill to remain in the condition of a governour; which in effect would be no other, then a common government var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed over, with a glorious Title to no effect, leaving the whole as ſubject to faction and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as if there were no King at all; in that he ſhould want the authority, although he were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the name neceſſary to that purpoſe: there were others that ſuddenly ſtarted up in the Senate-houſe, who imagined they had thought upon a way, to remedy all in conveniences; which was to have onely a King by election, either of <hi>Euarchus</hi> family or ſome other: but the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was quickly anſwered with theſe doubts: that if the Prince intended, ſhould be elected out of the ſame bloud, if not according to the direct line of ſucceſſion, it would endanger a new ſlaughter and faction, through the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by reaſon of ſeverall ambitious intereſts; of the other ſide, if he were abſolutely choſen out of another family, as no doubt but there would
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:98927:273"/>be many oppoſers, in the very election it ſelfe, ſo not poſſible to have any, of an extraction illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough, to warrant his kindred from being a burthen to the Commonwealth in their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and ſupport; which probably would prove a ſufficient inconvenience to the people; for that oftentimes juſtice would be ſold, &amp; other oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions committed, only to ſupply a needy and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent family: in concluſions, however many ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med willing againe to reſtore <hi>Euarchus,</hi> and his poſterity to their ancient rights and dignity, yet fearing in regard of their own proceedings, that they might be ſtrictly called in queſtion for their paſt actians, they utterly deſiſted from that reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: &amp; notwithſtanding theſe ſeverall and violent diſcourſes, for that time they ſetled upon no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination whatſoever; only at laſt they ordered, the government ſhould remaine as it was at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Senates power, though bearing ſtill the name of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> until farther conſideration: I muſt tell you, as theſe were the manner of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the Councels at <hi>Sardis,</hi> both before and ſince the revolt of the Army, ſo now by their favours as we ſuppoſe, they muſt aske leave of the Souldiers, before they ſettle either a government in themſelves, or take it away from others; And the rather am I induced to this beliefe, for that the common people, appeare not yet much ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized at the late revolt; but of the contrary, as tis thought, would be extremely ſatisfied with againe turne the ſtreame into its right courſe; however in that I ſhall ſay the leaſt that may be,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:98927:274"/>untill I be more inſtructed in the conſtitution of the world: with theſe words he ended his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and preſently tooke his leave; pretending ſome other company in his houſe, needed alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother part of his entertainment.</p>
                  <p>This information of the Hoſt, gave <hi>Creſes</hi> and the Prieſt occaſion, to fall into a more ſerious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, concerning the nature and property of Monarchy and other governments, according to divers opinions and judgements, with the ſeverall benefits and inconveniences belonging to them: The Prieſt would needs take upon him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kingly part; whilſt <hi>Creſes</hi> was to be content with the more inferiour degree: both notwithſtanding grounding their diſcourſes, from the hopes they had, that the Souldiers would ſhortly againe reſtore <hi>Euarchus</hi> to his Crowne and government: The Prieſt firſt began in this manner:</p>
                  <p>As Monarchy in the generall, ſaid he, hath been held by writers, to be the beſt and moſt abſolute way of government, ſo ought it as well be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that a Prince by deſcent and inheritance, is the freeſt of all others from burthen and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to the people; ſince the making up of new families upon every exchange, and the many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous factions would ariſe by reaſon of electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would at one time or other, either hazzard or ruine the Commonwealth; for that all ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, could never be ſuppreſt totally in every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with the only conſideration of the common ſafety: but that I may more particularly make good my argument, I ſhall endeavour from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:98927:274"/>principles of Divinity, nature, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to prove my affirmation and opinion: In the firſt place according to the example of the divine providence, there is but one God that made and now rules the heavens, ſince if there were more, none could be abſolute, much leſſe omnipotent in any kinde, and ſo conſequently the governement, ſhould ſtill be ſubject to variation, both in part and in the whole; for as divers perſons muſt have ſeverall wills, ſo that of neceſſity, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found commands and diſtract obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by executions, could not chuſe but be protracted to the rending of all actions and endeavours, of no conſiderable force and validity to the convenient and orderly rule of the world: wherefore we ſee, ſubordinate offices are appointed in every degree, by this great and all powerfull God; every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct orbe being ſo involved one within another, untill they all become governed by the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, onely to avoyd equality and confuſion: ſo that we may eaſily perceive by that decorum, that there is an entire neceſſity of one governour: As for example, there is but one Sun that governes the day, as another light ſhines in the night, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which being accompanied with any of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall authority or influence; as it were both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, to a certaine manner of abſolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy in their in their ſeverall kinds of motion and luſtre: in the ſecond place, by the very rules of nature we have experience, that ſome one in every ſpecies pretends above the reſt to dominion and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: as for the purpoſe, the induſtrious and painfull Commonwealth of the Bees, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:98927:275"/>one to goe before them, whoſe perſon and voyce they onely obey and follow, with a ſeeming care and extraordinary obedience: The ſilly Ants in like manner, have their Prince amongſt them, who ſeemes by his abſolute authority, only to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne and direct their labours, tending to unity and benefit in their ſmall and innocent Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: ſo that theſe being creatures no way gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to exorbitancy of will as men are, if it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for them to have but one governour, much more for us who are given in a manner to nothing but malice and pride, whereby to be kept in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and regulated in our diſpoſitions; which certainely cannot long be without the authority of ſome ſingle power, that muſt not be equalled or contracted by any other: we ſee if two ſtrange Balls be but turned looſe together in any paſture, their contention one with another never ends, whilſt one of the two have gained the abſolute maſlery over the other: with what extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hatred and malice will two little Cocks of the game, perſecute one another in bloud &amp; wounds, untill the one of them have obtained the victory by the others death and ruine? Ney example me if you can, any two Males of any generous kinde whatſoever, that will endure the others ſociety, without an abſolute ſubjection to his power and courage; as it were never but ſtriving till one have procured the entire juriſdiction of the place; as if nature by no meanes could admit of an equality in government; whereas of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Females, as being not at all ordained for rule and command, are ſeemingly contented with
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:98927:275"/>the ſociety, and company of their fellowes: which ſhews in my opinion a certaine kinde of neceſſity in all governments of one onely Monarch, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to avoid faction and confuſion, but to unite deſires and induſtry, towards the welfare and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of any Commonwealth; ſince without ſuch a knowne power and command, it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to bridle and keep in order at all times, the unruly fancies and exorbitant deſires of mankind: whoſe very nature or inclination, doth ſwell as it were with nothing but appetites of contention: Laſtly concerning the very inſtitution of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon earth: the firſt certainly was Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; for as in the beginning a man in his own private family, appeared to be the onely abſolute Prince to be obeyed, ſo dominions and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, became no other way eſtabliſhed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the world, but by the uniting together of ſeverall houſhols, either by accident or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; And though ſometimes people meerly out of neceſſity, to keep themſelves the better in peace and quietneſſe, were forced to chuſe and forme commonwealths, yet we ſcarce read of any juri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to be enterteined (at leaſtwiſe to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for any conſiderable ſpace) but where one ſingle power chiefly if not abſolutely commanded over the whole; as if the multitude by the very light of nature, being led thereunto by the meere dictates of reaſon, without any manner of ſcience or experience, were conſtrained to believe, that no other government, could be ſafe and laſting; however their Lords not ſeldome proved the cruelleſt Tyrants could be imagined: as I cannot
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:98927:276"/>deny, but by reaſon of the exorbitancy of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and wicked Princes, a State hath beene changed from a private to a popular Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth or government; yet ſcarce did I ever heare of any, but that both began and ended in Kingly authority; as being ſtill by ſome accident or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſtrained to that election or converſion, either in abſolute power, or mixt repreſentation, as if ſome kinde of neceſſity, required ſuch an eſtabliſhment to render it laſting, and convenient to the people.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> it is a moſt miſerable condition for the people, to be in a continuall ſubjection, under the power and command of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an impotent or an exorbitant Prince; for though he ſhould know what were beſt to be done, yet his perverſe nature and diſpoſition, would not ſuffer him to put it in execution. And if he knew not how to governe, he becomes led by the pride and covetouſneſſe of others: Again, put the caſe government might fall into the hands of a mad man or a fool, what remedy then could be expected, whereby the people might in any kinde have the leaſt hope of redreſſe? ſince by the Lawes and rules of inheritance, he were to continue ſtill without prevention and obſtacle; which of neceſſity ſometime or other would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; &amp; conſequently caſt the government into the hands of ſuch as he ſhould chuſe, that probably were not farre from his own temper in any thing: in like manner, it muſt be the ſame during the time of the Princes infancy, being by that meanes rendred altogether uncapable either of governing himſelf or others.</p>

                  <p>Tis true anſwered the Prieſt, the misfortune to a Kingdome is not ſmall when either of theſe happen: but however as no private intereſt can be ſo deſtroying as generall confuſion, ſo can it not be but much ſafer for a Commonwealth, to be under the juriſdiction of one vicious or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Prince (who tis likely will be glutted by his exceſſes, or may be aſſiſted in his Councels) then for it to be wholy governed by many diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing heads, and factious diſpoſitions, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſeverall wayes in their intentions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations, which of neceſſity muſt diſtract all profitable determinations, and at the beſt cannot but protract, if not abſolutely hinder thoſe execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions tending to peace and proſperity; being ſcarce to be avoyded in a common government, where opinions and intereſts are ſeverall in the rulers: beſides, it is well knowne that in ſuch Councels, ſecrets of the moſt higheſt nature (for that they are committed to many) are ſubject to be revealed if not betrayed.</p>
                  <p>But according to my ſenſe and beliefe ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> ſuch a Magiſtracy might be created out of the whole, that when good and neceſſary funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes were agreed upon, might eaſily governe with ſecrecy and moderation to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the people, who would be pleaſed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, in having the name of the election of ſuch Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>If you meane ſaid the Prieſt, that this juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ſhould be eternall, it were a great deale worſe and more dangerous in matters of Tyranny and injuſtice, then to be under one ſingle Prince,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:98927:277"/>by inheritance, ſince he might dye, and by that meanes, his ſucceſſor might againe bring eaſe and remedy, but the other aſſembly being once in the greater part corrupted, it were unpoſſible ever to expect any redreſſe at all; for that thoſe that ſhould happen to ſucceed, would come to their places but one by one, and conſequently could not have voyces in number ſufficient to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile the opinions of the reſt, remaining in the Councell or Magiſtracy: beſides if any ſhould have received injury, or endured oppreſſion by the caſting voyces of the whole aſſembly, to whom ſhould he flye for remedy and redreſſe? ſince every one ſingly would put off the blame from himſelfe; pretending not to have authority and power ſufficient, without the generality of that congregation, to repaire the injured perſon; which ſeldome or never could be procured: whereas being wronged or oppreſſed by a Prince, orany of his Officers or Miniſters of State, it would be no great difficulty, to make the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar complaint underſtood at one time or another to himſelfe; And more facile it would be a great deale, for the Monarch or governour ſpeedily to afford the remedy, either in that, that concerned his own perſon, or belonging to any of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners; for elſe he ſhould be forced to take upon him the blame, before the face of all the world; whereas the others actions, (that is to ſay concerning the particular) would be ſo involved in the darke, that it were almoſt impoſſible to make it appeare where the fault lay but in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall aſſembly; who without an infinite labour
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:98927:277"/>could not be brought to underſtand, much leſſe to redreſſe the grievance: And if you meane this magiſtracy or ſupreame authority, ſhould be only temporary, and ſo conſequently be made ſubject upon all occaſions to the election and queſtioning of the common people: what a world of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences would it bring? not only by continuall factions and diſorders, in the chuſing theſe new Magiſtrates, but in the very ſpight and heartbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, would be occaſioned thereby amongſt the people, being carried on to this election, by a certaine conceived greatneſſe in their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that might render their rude ambitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely unſatisfied, if they ſhould be at any time croſt in their choyce; with a thouſand other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences that I cannot mention.</p>
                  <p>Yet ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> alshough it ſhould be granted, that in thoſe particulars you have mentioned, Monarchy were to be eſteemed the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient government of all others; however it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, but that the common people are in that ſlavery under ſuch a juriſdiction, that they cannot poſſibly have hearts ſufficiently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately to render them entirely induſtrious, towards the profit and good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in the generall, in regard that however they toyle and take paines in abundance, they can never attaine to any places of dignity or reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in the Kingdome, either to content their thoughts or advance their eſteem; whereas in a popular ſtate, the meaneſt is in the ſame capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of preferment, as the higheſt borne perſon in he Countrey.</p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:98927:278"/>
                  <p>Although this be true ſaid the Prieſt; yet the defect proceeds not from their naturall unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but from their diſabillity or want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in regard of their deficiency in education, which inconveniency and defect, they will as well ſuffer in a popular government, as in a Kingly authority, ſince no worthy perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is debarred from preferment in a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, if his induſtry and parts can merit the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advancement; and although he ſhould in any kinde miſſe of his expectation, yet it would not grieve him ſo much to be under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Nobility, that are by birth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction above his condition as to finde himſelfe much ſubordinate and inferiour, to thoſe of his own ranke and quallity: to be eſteemed of all others moſt irkeſome to humane nature: ſo that you ſee it is but meere fancy, that engenders theſe conſiderations and opinions: beſides there are other inconveniences and omiſſions appertaining to a popular government; as for example, it ſeldome or never preferres or rewards worthy perſons according to their deſerts and merrits; when as for the moſt part ſmalleſt crimes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects are puniſhed by moſt fearefull and horrid ſeverity; proceeding either from envy or jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which is the occaſion that oftentimes, when Generalls, Commanders, or States men have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a ſufficient intereſt and eſteeme amongſt all ſorts of people, whereby to be able to contend, doubting their own ſafeties from the Magiſtracy, they enter preſently into ſuch rebellions that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turne the Commonwealth into a Tyrannicall
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:98927:278"/>Monarchy, or occaſion at the beſt ſo much bloud and ſlaughter, that every Subject thereof hath reaſon enough to feare his own loſſe, if not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall deſtruction; whereas a Prince being of ſo eminent a condition himſelfe, not to be equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by any of what quallity ſoever, hath no cauſe to be envious or ſuſpicious: againe the Prince hath a more neere intereſt in his Countries good then all his ſubjects beſides by way of perſonall honour; wherefore a greater benefit or loſſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends him in every thing, that is acted, ſince he creates not only the officer that commands or executes, but enjoyes the profit or diſprofit of the ſucceſſe, whereas the people in a Commonwealth receive it but in the generall, no one man being able to appropriate any publike action particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to himſelfe; which is a principall motive to enduce the Prince to attend earneſtly the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the government, becauſe he may be ſaid truly to eſteeme it his own, which no other priſon can doe in what conſtitution ſome ever, if there be others in equall authority with him; for to joyne intereſts, will never take ſo much the fancy and opinion of the owners, as thoſe which are ſingly appertaining but to one onely.</p>
                  <p>Well ſaid <hi>Creſes</hi>) although I ſee upon any termes you will needs have a Monarchy, to be the beſt government, yet nevertheleſſe I muſt not have a Prince altogether unlimited, as it were threatning a kinde of a fearefull apprehenſion of Tyranny to his people; by which meanes they would be hindred from endeavouring induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, either the common good or their private
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:98927:279"/>welfare: but rather I ſhould wiſh a king, in ſome ſort bound by lawes fundamentall, eſtabltſhed by a lawdable conſtitution at the firſt; however not to be ſo ſtrictly chayned up, that he were left no any power or prerogative at all, without his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects leave, or be ſo let looſe to his owne will and pleaſure, that he might injure, and oppreſſe his people as he liſt: that is to ſay, to have the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to enjoy ſuch a mixture in the whole, that the Subjects might not be over-bold, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach his preſence without an awfull reverence, or he to be puffed up with a vaine opinion (by reaſon of his dignity) that the Kingdome or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth was beſtowed upon his condition, more for his own uſe then the good of his people, nor I neither ſaid the Prieſt: whereupon being called away to ſupper they ſuddenly broake off the reſt of their diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>The next day about noone they arrived at Court, or rather was it to be called a campe, ſince the Souldiers ſeemed to beare all the ſway, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding others had a civil liberty allowed them, to be admitted upon every occaſion need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full into the Kings preſence.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Euarchus</hi> was enformed not onely of their arrivall, but that <hi>Creſes</hi> had brought him letters out of <hi>Syria</hi> from the Queen, he with a great deale of paſſion ſent preſently for them into his preſence: upon their enterance they found him ſeated in a kind of a confined Majeſty, <hi>Farezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> being on his right hand not farre from his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a little below him ſtood one <hi>Hercrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> his Lieutenant Generall, a man that ſeemed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:98927:279"/>to carry not only deſigne, but policy in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: about them, were placed many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſouldiers in the nature of a gard; however expreſſing more then ordinary freedome both in their lookes and demeanor: <hi>Creſes</hi> after he had performed his wonted reverencies, approached the King with a humility anſwerable to his Titles, though not his condition; preſenting him with the Queens letters, which <hi>Euarchus</hi> haſtily taking out of his hands read them with teares in his eyes, and then asked him ſundry queſtions both of his wife and ſon Prince <hi>Arethuſius;</hi> wiſhing withall he might once more have the happineſſe to enjoy their company in <hi>Lydia:</hi> whereunto <hi>Creſes</hi> ſoon replyed, that he did not doubt but that the gods ere long, would to that purpoſe be favourable to his pious intentions: Truly ſaid the King turning at the ſame time to <hi>Farezius,</hi> this brave comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, doth give me more then probable hopes to this effect: but <hi>Farezius</hi> made him no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, then by a kinde of humble bending of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſeemed to intimate a willingneſſe in any thing to comply with his deſires.</p>
                  <p>Having for ſome time thus diſcourſed together in publick, the King (alſo taking notice of the old Prieſt with more then ordinary affection) he led <hi>Creſes</hi> into an out window in the ſame roome, that was ſheltred from the view of the common people, by large Curtaines that reached to the ground, where after they had continued for the ſpace of an houre in private conference, the King calling unto him <hi>Farezius</hi> uſed this language, with ſuch a look, as might procure compaſſion
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:98927:280"/>from the cruelleſt Tyrant in the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Farezius,</hi> ſaid he, as I have ſufficient experience of your civilities, ſince it was my good fortune to be abſolutely under your juriſdiction, ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not I but preſume upon the continuance of theſe curteſies, finding your nature to be both noble and conſtant: wherefore to this purpoſe I would have you know, that it is not alone my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire at this preſent, to have ſome comfort and conſolation by the ſight and converſation of my children, kept ſo long from my poſſeſſion by the power of the Senate ſitting at <hi>Sardis,</hi> but laſo have received conjurations by theſe Letters from my wiſe remaining in <hi>Syria,</hi> if it be poſſible ſo farre to procure my own information concerning their particulars, that I may give her a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count both of their comportment and education, whereby the better to ſatisfie her motherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and naturall inclination: when the King had ended this ſupplication, ſo farre (as I may ſay) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath his dignity, though conſonant in ſome ſort to his condition, <hi>Farezius</hi> after a ſhort pauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Although I muſt confeſſe your Majeſties deſires, are grounded upon all the principles both of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and morallity, yet you muſt be pleaſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to know, that at preſent I finde my owne power and intereſt ſo farre weakned in <hi>Sardis,</hi> by the prevailing faction of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> that I dare not be over confident of any requeſt I ſhall make in your behalfe; eſpecially for that I am neither aſſured to continue ſtill the Senates Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or can procure thoſe Senators to be puniſhed
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:98927:280"/>that with ſo much violence, exclaime howerly at that attempt of ours concerning your releaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but nevertheleſſe if you pleaſe that <hi>Creſes</hi> now in communication with you, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as a meſſenger to demand theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſhall procure him as large a commiſſion as poſſibly I can from the whole Army to that effect, and being denyed by the Senate any of our juſt deſires, we may adde your authority to the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe of the Souldiers to force them from the oppoſers: as theſe motions were quickly imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Kings apprehenſion and conſent with many thankfull expreſſions, ſo <hi>Creſes</hi> wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courage nor loyalty to take upon him the execution to the beſt advantage both for <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſervice and the armies profit.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Creſes</hi> arrived at <hi>Sardis,</hi> and had with ſome eloquence and more judgement delivered his meſſage, being againe retired for about halfe an houres ſpace, he received theſe anſwers to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular from the Senate: firſt it was told him that whereas it was deſired, the Kings chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might not only performe their naturall duty to their father by a ſpeedy viſit, but might alſo for ſome confiderable time remaine in his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and converſation (however they conceived it againſt the rules of State policy to have any ſingle perſon pleaſured before the publike good) yet that <hi>Farezius</hi> ſhould ſee how much they valued his requeſt, the Senate had determined the children might make a journey to that effect, upon aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance given for their ſafe returne after ſome few dayes of ſaluation: againe whereas the Generall
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:98927:281"/>ſeemed to deſire a continuation of his power and command under the Senates authority, they not only granted him his owne demand, but wiſht <hi>Creſes</hi> to aſſure <hi>Farezius,</hi> that as they had never any intention to out him of his office, contrary to his own conſent, ſo would they ever be moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his brave and gallant ſervices: but for the propoſition that concerned the accuſation of ſome of their fellow Senators, they conceived it a derogation to the high places they held in the Commonwealth, to have them ſo much as ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, much leſſe to ſuffer them brought as guilty Malefactors before another Tribunall then their own, being perſons (as they ſaid) whom they had found moſt true and faithfull to the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt: Nevertheleſſe they condeſcended by way of perſwaſion, to cauſe them voluntarily to leave the Kingdome for ſome ſmall time, whereby the better to allay the rage and diſcontents of the Souldiers, untill they could be fully ſatisfied in their endeavours and fidelities; theſe anſwers did but in part give content to <hi>Creſes</hi> expectation; eſpecially for that the Senate ſeemed, not only as he conceived, to put on a kinde of more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inſolency in their demeanors, but withall did not ſo much as take any notice at all of <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> dignity, or that they intended any of thoſe reſpects for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Creſes</hi> with a great deale of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had attended their deliberations, yet he was content with ſome humility, to beg leave to viſit the Princeſſe, which being obtained, he found her ſeated in a melancholly roome, that had no
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:98927:281"/>more light beſtowed upon it, then what was meerely neceſſary, for the performance of thoſe ſervices due to her condition, her perſon being ſhut up in a black Couch, ſo obſcured with divers Curtaines, that ſcarce could her rare beauty be otherwiſe diſcovered, then as the faire Moone, ſhaddowed by too many blacke clowds; howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, now and then as the Princeſſe moved, there appeared bright and gentile rayes of thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which could not be altogether hid; in this manner being admitted to kiſſe her white hand, with many ſighes, and not a few teares, ſhe asked of her fathers health, with ſome other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances; but the uncompaſſionate guard would not ſuffer her to be ſo punctuall in her queſtions as ſhe deſired, untill at laſt <hi>Creſes</hi> was ſeparated againe from her preſence by thoſe watchfull ſpyes, that had the neereſt cuſtody of her perſon, who belike as guilty men, feared Treaſon in their very lookes, ſince no words were uttered but what they underſtood; ſo that he was conducted to the Caſtle gate onely by <hi>Roxana's</hi> ample complements, inſtead of her Miſtreſſes more full expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>But however the Senate had made theſe large promiſes during <hi>Creſes</hi> his preſence; yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon other conſiderations, they not onely denyed the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> acceſſe to her father, being unwilling belike to hazzard ſo pretious a Jewell out of their cuſtody, but thoſe Senators accuſed of Treaſon, with the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, within a very few dayes beſet the Senate houſe with multitudes of their faction, not onely
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:98927:282"/>denying to ſtand to the former Orders of giving <hi>Farezius</hi> poſſeſſion of the Caſtle of the Town; but alſo profeſſing, not to conſent to their own ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, alledging that the Generall rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the puniſhed as a Traitor; for having made ſo unjuſt and inſolent a demand, then themſelves to be judged for any crime, and were not onely liberall in their language, but cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Senate</hi> to diſannul their former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</p>
                  <p>The news of this inraged multitude was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought unto the knowledge of the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſo conſequently to <hi>Farezius,</hi> who after he had for ſome houres conſulted with the reſt of the Officers, reſolved to march towards the Walls of <hi>Sardis;</hi> where after a ſhort ſiege, and no great ſlaughter, the proud Inhabitants yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſolutely to his mercy, whilſt the chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the City, iſſued out to give him friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertainment, finding he had the greater par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Town. In this manner, with a moſt magnificent Triumph, they brought him to take poſſeſſion of that command, that before with ſome obſtinacy they had refuſed, and afterward moſt ceremoniouſly conducted him to the very <hi>Senate,</hi> in which place he was received with new honours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cloria</hi> having notice given her of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls intention, to viſit her, began to conſider with what reception ſhe ſhould entertain his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſince he appeared to her thoughts not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, who had lately conquered the whole Kingdom by his proſperity; but ſeemed at the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:98927:282"/>preſent to graſpe the very fate of her Father, and therefore believed ſhe was not to receive him in her accuſtomed ſad poſture, leaſt he might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it either a contempt of his power, or a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for his fortune; ſo that ſhe commanded her Chamber to be adorned with Hangings of green Velvet, belonging to the Kings Wardrope, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brodered with compartments of gold, wherein was wrought the ſeverall armories of her anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of both ſides, divided by certain colours of rich cloth of <hi>Tiſſue,</hi> interwoven with ſuch variety of beautifull flowers, that it ſeemed the Princeſs had placed her ſelf in a delicious Garden, to give <hi>Farezius</hi> the more delightfull welcome; which was increaſed by her own ſweet counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſeated upon a bed of the ſame Livery: though the inſide differed in invention, however it exceeded in curioſity, wherein with artificiall needlework, was deſigned the ſtory of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis</hi> with that lively art, that the bluſhing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger appeared in the boyes cheeks, at the laſcivious carriage of the Queen of Love, whilſt in other places he ſeemed to have put on a ſmiling coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, that he had broke from the forcible imbracements: but that which was admirably expreſſed in death it ſelf, accompanied with a lively ſorrow, was the amazed grief of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, when ſhe beheld her ſlaughtered Servant, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his own blood, torn with the rude Tusks of the ſalvage Boor, and his dejected followers, ſeemingly confounded at the object: Nor was it little leſs pittifull, to behold his poor Doggs here and there diſperſed, as if alſo they apprehended
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:98927:283"/>their own loſſe, by their Maſters deſtruction. Over the Chimney was a large Picture of moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent workmanſhip, wherein was ſet forth the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of proud <hi>Tarquin,</hi> by his enraged Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Farezius</hi> entred the room, he pawſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while (being ſurprized with an intire amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) before he approached the Princeſs, as if he apprehended ſome fear of ſacriledge in attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an appearing deity; but being invited by a gentle ſmile, that afforded not onely a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er encouragement to him, but added new grace, to her own beauty, he advanced with ſlow ſteps to perform thoſe reverences due to her dignity, which at laſt brought him to that diſtance, that gave her conveniency to aske him concerning her Fathers State; in which demand ſhe put on ſuch a look, that ſhewed ſhe deſired ſomething (though in works ſhe begged nothing) that eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay within his power to grant. But the Gods ſeemed too cruel to make her a mendicant, whoſe perfections deſerved rather to have ſufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to command all hearts: However, the Generall, as if at the preſent he underſtood little elſe but admiration, for a long time anſwered not her queſtions, which gave occaſion to <hi>Cloria</hi> again to redouble her paſſion, with other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogations upon the ſame ſubjects; ſo that <hi>Farezi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> at laſt breaking through his amazement, told her that he was in as proſperous a condition, as the unfortunate affaires of the Common-weale would permit, wherein he had imployed his beſt ſervice with all loyalty.</p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:98927:283"/>
                  <p>This anſwer ſcarce gave ſatisfaction to the Princeſs, ſince ſhe conceived <hi>Farezius</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his whole endeavours for the preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the King in his ancient dignity; and therefore turn'd away from his ſight with a few gentle teares in her fair eyes; which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Generall, he humbly beſought her to put off all ſadneſs from her heart, for that he did not doubt, but proſperity would ſucceed to her Father, according to his merit, and her own wiſhes; however the iſſue as he ſaid, muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended yet with ſome patience, ſince firſt the Souldiers were to be paid, who had ſpilt their blood freely for the liberty of their Country; and the common people in like manner muſt be ſatisfied, that had hitherto paid for the purchaſe. But what the ſweet <hi>Cloria</hi> would have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this diſcourſe could not be known, ſince <hi>Farezius</hi> occaſions call'd him ſuddenly away from her preſence into the City, not ſo much to receive thoſe Triumphs prepared for his further entertainment, as to procure money for his Army.</p>
                  <p>Though the Generall continued ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence againſt the rich Town of <hi>Sardis</hi> in impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning their chief Officers, as alſo in cauſing thoſe <hi>Senators</hi> which he had formerly accuſed to be ſent into baniſhment, yet the affaires of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archus</hi> became no whit more amended, ſince he was not onely ſtill detained as a Priſoner, though with ſomething a greater liberty and freedom, but the <hi>Senate</hi> was permitted to preſs his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with thoſe former propoſitions they had
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:98927:284"/>ſent by <hi>A gyllius</hi> prejuditiall to his Crown, and in truth to the abſolute taking away of all his royall authority; which gave occaſion of many diſcourſes amongſt all ſorts of people: ſome ſaid that <hi>Farezius</hi> was in love with the Princeſs <hi>Cloria,</hi> and by that means endeavoured to force the Kings conſent to the mariage, whom he thought elſe could not be brought to yield to ſuch unequall Nuptialls, much leſs would his Daughter be won to give up her perſon to thoſe diſadvantages, who had been courted by all the great Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> with multitudes of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offers. Others again believed, the contrary faction began to prevail, and had by ſome means either bribed <hi>Farezius</hi> to their party, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witted his deſigns. Neither wanted there a third Company that imagined, the people grew wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their own ſufferings, by reaſon of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies free quarter, ſuſpecting the Generalls power &amp; intentions only to make himſelf &amp; his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers mighty, without looking upon their liberties and proſperity. For a teſtimony of which as they ſuppoſed, the Nobility carried the chief ſway in the <hi>Senate Houſe,</hi> contrary to their deſires; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, certain <hi>Trybunes</hi> were choſen in the Army, to preferr the rights of the ordinary Souldiers and common people.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt theſe thoughts, or rather fancies were toſt to and fro, almoſt in every mans boſom; for that the whole affairs of the Kingdom were at a ſtand, and <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſeemingly no nearer his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement then the firſt day he was impriſoned; nay farther off in moſt opinions: <hi>Roxana</hi> one
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:98927:284"/>morning, according to her cuſtom (being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with more feares than ordinary; for that the Princeſs her Miſtriſs, appeared to her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not a little concerned in the buſineſs, ſince it was not improbable, ſome ſparkles of love joyned with <hi>Farezius</hi> ambition, might be obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt the Kings proſperity) came to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her ſelf, within certain groves belonging to the Caſtle, which were ordered into many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull walks, that here and there croſſed one another, for the more conveniency of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that ſhould frequent them for recreation; where long ſhe had not remained, diſputing with her doubts and hopes, but ſhe met accidentally with <hi>Creſes,</hi> who ſeemed to be there with the ſame intention; they both appeared pleaſed at the incounter, whereupon <hi>Creſes</hi> quickly asked her after ſome ſhort ſalutation, what ſhe thought of the ſtrangeneſs of theſe times, ſo much chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed contrary to both their expectations, when as they looked rather for the King to have been royally received in <hi>Sardis,</hi> then to have been ſtill continued a priſoner, much leſs to be preſſed with new propoſitions, diſhonourable to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and deſtructive to his authority.

                     </gap> the iſſue, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I muſt confeſ myfears outgoe my faith, in any good they mean the Kings power, ſince both the delayes uſed, and much more theſe Articles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, are no good Omens to <hi>Euarchus</hi> proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but take off rather that glory which <hi>Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:98927:285"/>ſhould have obtained to himſelf, if he had made the Kings reſtoration to his rights, his firſt and chiefeſt work, ſince by his power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the reſt of the neceſſary affairs of the Kingdom, would in all probability have been better and ſurer ſetled, when they ſhould have carried with them both Law and Juſtice. You are in the right Madam ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> wherefore if I may not be thought over tedious to your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I will diſcourſe to you ſome things which I have not only heard from the Kings own mouth, when I laſt waited upon him; but other obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations I took when I was in <hi>Syria,</hi> by which you may make what conjectures you pleaſe. So taking the old woman by the hand, he led her to a little banquetting houſe, not far off for the more privacy; where, after they were both ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he made unto her this Relation.</p>
                  <p>Madam ſaid he, firſt you muſt underſtand, that <hi>Euarchus</hi> the King is oppoſed in his juſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rather legall authority, by four facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that for the preſent ſeek to undermine one another, all having abſolutely in their hearts, caſt off their obedience to the Kings Perſon and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative. The <hi>Senate</hi> ſtrives with violence to maintain that jurisdiction, it hath extorted from him; as the <hi>Myſians</hi> endeavour out of a high covetouſneſs, to be ſhares in the Government and Riches of this flouriſhing Kingdom. Neither wants the Army pretentions, by reaſon of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they have done in the late Warres, to claim reward and ſubſiſtance. And laſt of all, the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> in regard it hath for the moſt
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:98927:285"/>part furniſhed the Soudiers and Councell with money, requires to be made a free Town; that is to ſay, to depend upon no ſubjection, but what Magiſtrates created by themſelves ſhall preſcribe. This contention of all ſides, is the chief occaſion as 'tis thought, that makes every thing at a ſtand, whilſt in the mean time, the people ſeem to cry out, being overburthened with oppreſſions and payments, which in the end certainly cannot but turn to an abſolute confuſion, ſince there is ſcarce poſſibility left to ſatisfie all parties: And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the common ſtate of things.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the proceedings of <hi>Syria,</hi> which I have moſt from the Kings own mouth, be pleaſed to underſtand, that when he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to aſſemble this great Councel, that hath proved ſo unfortunate to his happineſs, there was ſent into <hi>Lydia</hi> from <hi>Philoſtros</hi> an <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> as <hi>Euarchus</hi> imagined for his conſolation and aſſiſtance, againſt the violent proceedings of his <hi>Senate;</hi> but preſently after his arrivall, he was ſo far from complying with the Kings occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that he kept a frequent correſpondence, with thoſe perſons that ſeemed moſt to oppoſe his authority; in ſo much, as the King was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained at laſt with ſome violence, not only to forbid him any longer attendance upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but earneſtly to deſire the State of <hi>Syria,</hi> to recall him home from all further imployment in <hi>Lydia,</hi> which ſetled the thoughts of <hi>Euarchus</hi> in ſome quietneſs, whilſt his own victories over his diſobiendient ſubjects, and the death both of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:98927:286"/>
                     <hi>Philoſtros</hi> and <hi>Orsſames,</hi> gave the King more then probable hopes of a ſmall and happy ſucceſſe in his enterprize, which was againe in a very ſhort time, to reduce all <hi>Lydia</hi> under his lawful juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: but belike the State of <hi>Syria</hi> following the ſame maximes of government, under the young, ſon <hi>Orſames</hi> had left behind him, contrary to all humane expectation, ſent preſently after the death of <hi>Orſames</hi> another Ambaſſador to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> not only a new to invite him to breake the League which he ſtill continued with the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but to allow his conteſting Senate to be a lawfull and continued Councell by his abſolute approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thinking belike, that it would better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the affaires of <hi>Syria,</hi> to have <hi>Euarchus</hi> power limitted, then to ſuffer him to remaine in his high prerogative: but theſe demands the King moſt violently and diſdainfully refuſing, the Ambaſſador not only with ſome ſeeming diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent took his leave, but as it was thought invited the <hi>Myſſians</hi> againe into <hi>Lydia,</hi> which hath been as you know the reaſon of <hi>Euarchus</hi> overthrow, ſince the Senates ſingle power, had never probably prevailed againſt his fortune and ſucceſſe; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the buſineſſe did not yet reſt; for after the King had notwithſtanding ſtrugled with infinite difficulties, to make good ſtill his declining cauſe (his ſon <hi>Arethuſius</hi> Forces alſo being deſtroyed in many ſet Battells, who after fled into <hi>Syria</hi> to the Queen his Mother) <hi>Euarchus</hi> was forced to put himſelfe under the protection of the <hi>Myſſians</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; yet with ſo little benefit to his affaires, that in a ſhort time after he was delivered in perſon
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:98927:286"/>into his enemies hands, who treated him with all manner of hardneſſe, untill the Army took him violently from that juriſdiction: As this Madam, is the ſad particulars I can relate unto you, of the Kings misfortunes and captivity, ſo may you very well make conjecture of the conſequences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> after ſhe had thanked him for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wherein as ſhe ſaid, he had made her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with ſome paſſages, ſhe never underſtood before, yet he ſhould oblige her much more if he would be pleaſed to deliver his opinion, what might be the intentions of the <hi>Syrian</hi> State, in thus deſiring to leſſen, or rather to outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence to overthrow the Monarchy of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſince the example ſeemed of a dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence for its own government, for that thoſe Subjects might alſo fall upon the like pretences.</p>
                  <p>Truly anſwered <hi>Creſes,</hi> what I can ſay of that Theame is, that either they thinke it more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the glory of <hi>Syria,</hi> to reduce all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes but their owne, into Commonwealths, whereby theirs may appeare to <hi>Aſia</hi> the onely Empire: or they have an intention to make a conqueſt of ours, by reaſon of thoſe multitudes of diviſions, they ſee ariſing amongſt our ſelves; or perhaps, they ayme to ſet up Prince <hi>Arethuſius</hi> in his fathers Kingdome, becauſe he is of the <hi>Syrian</hi> bloud, whereby they believe they ſhall purchaſe both honour and friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>But if I thought I ſhould not prove over harſh in my unpolliſht language, whereby too much to injure your patience by my tedious relation, I would diſcover yet a ſtory, though acted long
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:98927:287"/>time ſince, that in my opinion, hath been the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the ſad effects of this laſt Warre: it will prove the longer, in regard it toucheth the proceedings, not only of the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> but the Countries of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Myſſia,</hi> that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly have been all three interwoven in dangers, ſlaughters and civill broyles, by the ſpightfull proceedings, and factions maximes, of a certaine Prieſt called <hi>Herenzius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> glad to entertaine any conveniency, that might inſtruct her farther, in the Myſteries of theſe unlucky times, although many things ſhe had read of <hi>Herenzius</hi> violent ſpirit, told <hi>Creſes,</hi> that as no language proceeding from his lips, could prove tedious to any eare how ignorant ſoever; ſo did ſhe not doubt, but the conſequence of the preſent affaires, required rather ample ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, then ſhort deſcriptions, which gave him a ſufficient warrant to uſe his own pleaſure, both for the manner and matter of his diſcourſe, untill his endeavours produced this following relation.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know ſaid he, that this Prieſt <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius</hi> ſome yeares ſince, when all the world ſeemed to yeild obedience to the great <hi>Flamine</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> as the only Oracle upon earth to preſcribe the manner of the worſhip of the gods, ſuddenly ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up in the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> who by reaſon of an ignominions puniſhment he had undergone (as twas reported for a hainous offence committed againſt humane and divine Lawes) began violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fall out with heaven and earth; in ſo much as in the firſt place, he quarrelled with the forme of the ſervice to the Gods then uſed; and in the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:98927:287"/>latter, he denyed Kings and Princes obedience, or rather loyalty from their naturall ſubjects; To this purpoſe to execute his malice againſt all authority, becauſe he had ſuffered by it; and withall thinking againe in ſome ſort to recover his loſt reputation, in doing notable actions, how wicked ſoever, of a ſudden flew to a certaine Towne upon the confines of <hi>Arabia,</hi> whoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had newly, not only diſobeyed their <hi>Flamine</hi> but caſt off their government to his authority, which quickly gave him admittance, with his Doctrine, ſince they knew his opinions ſuited with their deſignes; yet being rather friendly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, then perfectly eſtabliſhed by their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, his inſolency and pride in a ſhort time, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him againe from the City, ſeeing he could not ſhew temper in his firſt entrance; and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained untill the feare of the inhabitants, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming once more under their old government, for that they underſtood their Prince prepared for a ſiege, conſtrained them, not onely a new to deſire his company, whereby to be aſſiſted by his Councell, but were forced to binde themſelves by a ſolemne oath, to ſubmit abſolutely their wills to his inſtitutions: with theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he became fully poſſeſſed of that power, that gave him opportunity, both to governe as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and inſtruct as he liſted, untill he had fitted all their thoughts, for the impreſſions of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes by the eloquent language, and cunning practices he uſed, which in a ſhort time ſo proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, that many diſciples were found of ſuch towardly diſpoſitions, inſtructed by his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:98927:288"/>that he ſent many of them alſo into other Countries, to poyſon the peoples loyalties, ſince obedience is the moſt aſſured tye, that probably warrants the ſafety and proſperity of Kingdomes. But theſe men having as I ſaid, taken their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes with theſe intentions, the firſt prevailing progreſſe they made, was in the Countrey of <hi>Myſſia,</hi> where finding ſome diſcontents already ingendring between the young Queen then raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grandmother to <hi>Euarchus:</hi> and ſome factious and ambitious Nobility, ſoon introduced their new and dangerous opinions, into the hearts of the common people, by which meanes the Lords became alſo ſo powerfull by their aſſiſtance, that the poore Princeſſe in a ſhort ſpace, was forced to quit both her Kingdome and Life, a Tragedy too pittifull now to be related, whilſt the Rebells took poſſeſſion of her authority, from which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpation proceedes <hi>Lydia's</hi> miſeries, ſince by a continuance of the ſame deſires in thoſe people towards her poſterity, they have now filled this Kingdome with tumults, troubles, and bloud, the better to make good their own juriſdictions ſo unlawfully purchaſed in former times: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe opinions of depoſing of Kings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the worſhip of the gods, prevailed entirely in <hi>Myſſia,</hi> by reaſon of thoſe crafty and factious actors that <hi>Herezius</hi> had ſent; yet his Doctrine found not ſo ready acceptance in the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> for that the Queen then raigning, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured againſt the violence of all their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, both to conſerve Monarchy, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their <hi>Flamines,</hi> though the State altered
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:98927:288"/>many Tenents in Doctrine, untill the late agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of each Nation to oppoſe <hi>Euarchus</hi> in the ſame deſigne, contrived an accord to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate in effect both King and <hi>Flamines:</hi> This may paſſe my diſcourſe to the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> that hath not only formerly borne part in the ſuffering, by reaſon of theſe opinions ſowed in the world, but hath been a principall occaſion to give the <hi>Myſſians</hi> protection, by whoſe power <hi>Euarchus</hi> hath been chiefely deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>To which purpoſe you muſt underſtand, that although <hi>Herezius</hi> other meſſengers, could not ſo eaſily beate downe the ſtrong Walles of Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, eſtabliſhed by ſo many ages in <hi>Syria,</hi> againſt the power of great Armies alwayes kept in pay by that Nation, yet oftentimes they filled the whole Kingdome with moſt lamentable ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to gaine enterance for their opinions, and freedome for their Doctrine; in ſo much as the Prince himſelfe then governing, finding the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples overthrowne, his Countrey ſpoyled, and his Subjects deſtroyed by the fury of the contention, was forced at laſt, ſo farre to give way to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezians</hi> religion in <hi>Syria,</hi> that they had not only granted them, a free exerciſe of their conſciences throughout all his dominions, [but many fortified Townes were delivered into their hands; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they put their owne Garriſons, to ſecure better this agreement, which both afforded him peace, and ſeemed to give them ſatisfaction for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: however, every yeare almoſt after notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe benefits, produced new ſtirres by that faction, to the diſquieting of the Kingdome,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:98927:289"/>that gave ſufficient cauſe of vexation to many good Princes, ſince they could not be aſſured of the loyalty of their obliged Subjects, nor of the continuation of their owne proſperities, when neither graces could win them by reaſon of the ſpleen they bore to Monarchy, or power could compell them in regard of thoſe Forts they had in their cuſtody.</p>
                  <p>But to be ſhort, before the great and wiſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite <hi>Philoſtros,</hi> durſt take upon him the huge worke he intended, which was to ſuppreſſe the gloriouſneſſe of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Empire, he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned he could not be abſolutely ſafe at home, and ſo conſequently not fitted for ſo large a conqueſt, as long as he ſhould leave behind him in his own boſome, ſo eminent a danger as thoſe he eſteemed lawleſſe Subjects in <hi>Orſames</hi> Kingdome, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would upon all occaſions, be ready to joyne with forraigne Forces, to overthrow their owne Kings government, and therefore reſolved firſt, before he undertooke any new deſigne, to ſubdue their power, to the abſolute obedience of his great Maſters juriſdiction, as in times paſt it had been to ſome of his predeceſſors; to which purpoſe he not only ſuddenly beſieged the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Towne they had in <hi>Syria,</hi> but within a ſhort ſpace, left them never a Fort in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that was not conſtrained to deliver up the Keyes of its Gates, to the will and pleaſure of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Orſames,</hi> who began to grow great in the opinion of the world, by the conqueſt of his own Subjects, that were accuſtomed to give ſufficient imployment to other Kings.</p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:98927:289"/>
                  <p>However, after that <hi>Philoſtros</hi> had made this ſpeedy progreſſe in glory, as well as in ſecurity for his Maſters apparant advantage, both in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Subjects at home, and terrifying his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies abroad, which proved mighty advantages for thoſe deſignes he had contrived in his politick braine, becauſe it was not convenient, and ſcarce ſafe to continue deſperate diſcontents in ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a body, that had vaſtly ſpread it ſelfe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough moſt Countries in <hi>Aſia,</hi> whilſt his thoughts and endeavours were otherwiſe to be imployed; he began by little and little, to ſmooth his brow towards that ſect, and at laſt not only aſſured them of his abſolute forgetting all faults paſt, but made many of them chiefe officers and commanders in that Army <hi>Orſames</hi> provided, to goe againſt the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Forces, wherein he craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily procured a double commodity to his affaires, the one in winning a party he had good cauſe to ſuſpect, and the other in rendring them ingaged in the quarrell, he intended againſt <hi>Soraſtros;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he was moſt aſſured, that they would fight with ſpleen againſt that religion by nature they moſt hated, ſince the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of all others were held obſequious to the rights and ceremonies of <hi>Delphos,</hi> which alſo was a meanes to binde the <hi>Myſſians</hi> to the affaires of <hi>Syria,</hi> ſince no Nation or people in <hi>Aſia,</hi> profeſſed more violently the ſame worſhip of the gods introduced by <hi>Heren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zius,</hi> and exerciſed by his followers in <hi>Orſames</hi> dominions, which were not onely reaſons to tye <hi>Philoſtros</hi> to that ſect, by all the favours he could procure it in his own Country, whereby to make
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:98927:290"/>them ſerviceable in the Warres, he had with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtros,</hi> but by that meanes gave countenance to the <hi>Myſſians</hi> againſt <hi>Euarchus</hi> their lawfull Prince; which by conſequence afforded the Senate of <hi>Lydia</hi> conveniency alſo to ſuppreſſe his power, that they might not ſeeme to goe leſſe in juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in maſtering their King, then thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they had bought with their money, onely to doe them ſervice, ſo that by this meanes the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite gave worke enough at home to <hi>Euarchus,</hi> that he ſhould not have the opportunity, although he might have the wil to aſſiſt the King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which the pollicy of every Nation requires ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome opinions, when a Prince is not able to make good his party againſt another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Monarch.</p>
                  <p>This Madam as I ſay, hath been the fate of theſe mighty Kingdomes, only troubled by the cunning induſtry of one factious and ambitious Prieſt, as if the Gods had ſent him into the world to let man ſee his owne frailty; and the rather for that <hi>Euarchus</hi> not many yeares agoe, appeared ſo glorious and fortunate in his government, crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a flouriſhing proſperity, in wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, peace, and power, that he was not only the abſolute envy of all <hi>Aſia,</hi> but ſeemed to carry in his hand the arbitration of the world; being now caſt downe into ſo low, and I may call it miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, by a little faction of his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he is not only denyed to be a King, but deprived of the comfort of all that ever was his, with an addition of a ſharpe and laſting captivity, according to the diſcretion ſometimes of his
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:98927:290"/>meaneſt Subjects; whilſt in the interim, honour, love, juſtice, and gratitude ſeeme to be laid a ſleep in the deep Center of the earth, other Princes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watching to their own prepoſterous ſpleen, not conſidering how ſoon it may be their fortunes, to fall under the ſame Fate, for that all men natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly covet liberty; with theſe words he reſted ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with his armes acroſſe, as if yet his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, went higher then his tongue was able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe. This diſcourſe gave the old woman alſo ſome leaſure to ſhed a few teares, in conſidering the Kings misfortunes,</p>
                  <p>But as he was proceeding farther, they were both interrupted by the ſudden arrivall of the little dwarfe, who told <hi>Roxana,</hi> that he had been a long time ſearching her all over the Parke, to informe her, that the Princeſſe was newly deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the garden to take ſome recreation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dinner, and deſired earneſtly her company, to impart ſomething of conſequence to her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; This gave <hi>Roxana</hi> no more opportunity, then civilly to thanke <hi>Creſes</hi> for thoſe informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he had given her, profeſſing againe ſhe was inſtructed in many things ſhe had never heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that might afford light as ſhe ſaid, to her comportment and converſation, ſince ſhe was dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſpute with ſome enemy or other in <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> quarrell; and withall deſired him he would be pleaſed, to put on a reſolution often to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her in that place, not only for her better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, but for ther Miſtreſſes conſolation, which you may be ſure was a tickling motive to invite <hi>Creſes</hi> to the ſervice, being perſwaded, the

                     <hi>Roxana</hi> when ſhe came into the Garden, ſhee found the Princeſſe retired into a cloſe walk, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by interwoven branches of green leaves from the Sunnes oppreſſion, which alſo obſcured her in ſome fort from the ſight of her attendants; ſo that the old woman had occaſion given her by that retirement, to believe new accidents had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſolitude: Wherefore approaching at a neerer diſtance, ſhe might perceive a paper in <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> hand, whilſt ſhe ſtood ſtill lifting up her faire eyes to the heavens, then againe caſt them downe upon the ground, and in this poſture ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced two or three ſteps, with a kinde of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent motion; this continued <hi>Roxana</hi> the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before ſhe diſcovered her being there, untill the Princeſſe turning that way, ſhe was neceſſarily invited to preſent her ſelfe; however ſhe had not come neere her by a few paces, but <hi>Cloria</hi> with a deepe ſigh, inſtead of other expreſſions, caſt her the paper ſhe held, which the old woman preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reading, found it ſpake this matter:</p>

                     <hi>Roxana</hi> after ſhe had read the Letter, ſtood ſtill ſometime in a Muſe, untill at laſt paſſionately ſhe broake out into theſe words: Truly Madam ſaid ſhe, las I cannot but ſmile at the former part of the writing, ſo muſt I needs wonder at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſince it ſeemeth as prepoſterous, Prince <hi>Caſſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſhould after a long ſilenee, attempt your love, when hee remained quiet during the Generals ſuppoſed greatneſſe, as it appeares ſtranger to my thoughts, the King hath now removed his Quarters, when he was ſuppoſed ſecure in <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezius</hi> protection. But alaſſe ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> I rather marvell whither my Father can poſſibly be fled to purchaſe more hopes, for that all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is probably out of his juriſdiction; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhould be glad to flatter my ſelfe with ſome opinions, that the deſigne was undertaken upon good grounds. As I cannot promiſe that anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Roxana,</hi> yet certainly the King being ſo wiſe, would never have ventured upon ſuch a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous attempt, without long conſideration and aſſured friends to conduct him to his journeyes
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:98927:292"/>end; but if I may rove according to my wilde imagination, either he is gone into <hi>Syria,</hi> ſince I cannot believe he would any more truſt his perſon with the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> who have divers times deceived him; or is invited into <hi>Creet</hi> by his Subjects there in Armes againſt the Senate, the better to make good their cauſe againſt the new <hi>Lydian</hi> Forces, preparing to bring them ſpeedily under ſubjection. The gods will be done ſaid the poore Princeſſe, but I feare the worſt; Theſe diſcourſes brought them to the reſt of the company in the Garden, to make them alſo ſharers of the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected newes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana</hi> the next morning had ſcarce leaſure given her to welcome the day, when ſhe was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed by a meſſenger ſent from <hi>Creſes,</hi> that within two houres ſpace, he would attend her if ſhe pleaſed, at the banquetting houſe amongſt the Woods, not only to finiſh out the reſt of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, but alſo to let her know other paſſages worth her acceptance. The old Matron concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, it was ſome intelligence more particular concerning the Kings departure, ſent him thanks, and promiſed with all diligence to wait upon the ſummons, which ſhe performed a pretty while before <hi>Creſes</hi> arrivall, that gave her opportunity to examine her own imagination; but it was not long before ſhe was interrupted by his appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which with a few ceremonies ſeated them both together as the day before, whilſt <hi>Creſes</hi> uſed this language.</p>
                  <p>Though I may ſuppoſe (ſaid he) you have heard ſomething of the Kings departure from
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:98927:292"/>under the protection of the Army; yet perhaps you have not as yet been enformed of the reaſons and particulars of his retirement; or rather I may call it an eſcape, ſince he was perſwaded it would be for his better ſafty: <hi>Roxana</hi> confeſſing, ſhe knew nothing of the manner much leſſe the cauſe, though common fame had brought the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to her eares; <hi>Creſes</hi> gave her this farther ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the paſſage, according to the relation he had from an officer intruſted in the ſervice as he ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The King ſaid he, being not only ſuſpitious of the ſecurity of his perſon, by reaſon of the many diviſions of opinion in the Campe; ſome deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Prince, others none; eſpecially conſidering the diverſity of humours amongſt the common Souldiers, who generally laboured for an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall equality, as alſo being credibly enformed that unleſſe he would preſently condeſcend to thoſe propoſitions formerly ſent unto him, with the addition of ſome priviledges demanded that were more deſtractive to his Crowne and dignity, he ſhould infallibly be murthered, he was conſtrained to this ſudden retirement; however I muſt tell you theſe rumours were given out as 'twas belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, only to fright him to ſeek another ſtation, where he might be againe impriſoned with ſome colour and better ſecurity, as pretending his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to eſcape out of the Armies juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and power: ſo that the poore King fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cauſes enough for a ſuſpition, acquainted two of his ſervants both with his feares and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, who to be ſhort, perſwaded him to fly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:98927:293"/>to an Iſland upon the borders of <hi>Caria,</hi> where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines as governour a valiant commander, though formerly imployed by the Senate, yet at the preſent was conceived to be wholly at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Farezius</hi> and the Army: this Captaine they aſſured him would be entirely faithfull to his deſignes, though upon what grounds I can neither informe you or ſatisfie my ſelfe, ſince the conſequence proved otherwiſe: for no ſooner was the King arrived under his juriſdiction, but he entertained him not only with a ſad and ſowre countenance, but after he had ſecured his perſon in the Caſtle, and ſent away his two officers, he preſently gave information to the Senate of all the proceedings, deſiring further directions in what manner he ſhould be treated; though he carries ſtill in his demeanour, a kinde of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his dignity: all theſe paſſages as I told you before, I have from one of thoſe perſons new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned, that accompanied him in the journey, with this advertizement alſo that before the Kings departure from the Campe, he left in his chamber under his own hand, the reaſon of his feares and his eſcape: all which Madam I may ſay is in ſuch a miſt, that no leſſe a knowledge then ſome divine Oracle can informe us concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the certainty of the myſtery: only we may be confident that <hi>Euarchus</hi> hath imployment e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for his courage and patience: At theſe words <hi>Roxana</hi> wept againe with the very fence of the Kings dangers and miſeries: Nay ſaid <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> his ſuffering of all ſides are ſo extreame, that notwithſtanding he hath ſent to <hi>Farezius</hi> and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:98927:293"/>offered to accord every difference and intereſt in the Kingdome, being heard; yet neither the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall nor Senate will entertaine the motion, or allow him that priviledge, fearing belike he ſhould ſpeak too much reaſon to render his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſatisfied, whereby they might be endangered to loſe that authority which now they poſſeſſe without contradiction. But ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> why doe the common people deſire violently no King, ſince <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſhewes ſuch teſtimonies of his goodneſſe? Truly ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> as that opinion in the Generall is erronious, ſince all be not of that faction, ſo of the other ſide, there be too many that wiſh an univerſall equality, not conſidering the confuſion it would bring upon the whole Kingdome, being as it were bewitched with an ignorant pride; for moſt of them by ſuch a parity, would be in more ſlavery then they are now, ſince they could never be capable of any command, and neceſſarily muſt obey thoſe that would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne with more rigour, though elected from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves: beſides they are now ſo weary of the Senates rule in the ſame poſture, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ſome experience of their managing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires hitherto, that they believe their owne cure can proceed from nothing but deſperate change, which is incident to all diſtempered minds; ſince they that could not be well under <hi>Euarchus</hi> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable government, wherein they enjoyed all wealth and proſperity (though no doubt but there was ſome abuſes) certainly now will not reſt ſatisfied when they ſhall feele nothing but want, oppreſſion, and inſtability; beſides many
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:98927:294"/>feare that things are not yet at the worſt, when ſo many contrary intereſts with violence ſeeme to contend. Theſe diſcourſes brought them both at laſt in diſpute; whether active valour, or paſſive courage were the greater vertue, in that <hi>Euarchus</hi> ſeemed to poſſeſſe them in a high kinde. But <hi>Creſes</hi> who had a dainty wit, defended the latter with theſe arguments: firſt ſaid he, before we can well conſider what hath been the Kings ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, we muſt rightly ſtate his misfortunes, which will appeare to be the greater, when it is well knowne to the world, he hath alwayes ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courage in the Warres, by ventaring boldly his perſon upon all occaſions, as alſo eloquence and judgement both by his Pen and language, when thoſe faculties of Art and Nature were thought neceſſary and uſefull; a plaine demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration that he wants not ſenſe and knowledge fully to apprehend his own oppreſſions: and the rather may it be ſo thought, for that thoſe who have moſt gained by his favours, the ungratefull <hi>Myſſians,</hi> with ſome others of his owne Court, have been the chiefe Inſtruments, or rather I may ſay the only cauſe that have deprived him not only of the priviledge of his royall Crowne, but of all the perſonall happineſſes he enjoyed in his proſperity; beſides his want of liberty now at laſt to make up the full <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of his miſery, none almoſt giving eare to his complaints, or pittying his captivity: though they have ſeparated him from his beloved Queene, in whoſe beauty and vertues he took an unſpeakable felicity, as alſo the comfort of beholding his ſweet children, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:98927:294"/>a reall part of himſelfe, which the gods and nature have ordained to man as a humane right; accompanied with the detention of his revenues that ſhould maintaine him and them: beſides proſecuting him with as many ſlanders as they can invent.</p>
                  <p>This Madam as it may be ſuppoſed, being the true condition of <hi>Euarchus</hi> misfortune, it may eaſily be conjectured, his ſufferings are equall, if not goe beyond example, and yet his noble heart holds out ſtill to endure as you ſee, what malice can invent without breaking; who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding offers love, mercy and patience to his whole Kingdome and worſt injurers: things being in this poſtare I ſhall proceed to the making good of my promiſed argument; which is, that paſſive courage is a greater vertue then active valour; if my diſcourſes doe not ſeeme too tedious for your more neceſſary imployment.</p>
                  <p>As I muſt call the Kings conſtancy a noble for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, ſince he hath neither Subject of hope, nor object of diverſion, ſo certainly is it the higheſt magnanimity for a Prince to ſuffer patiently and without confuſion from his own Subjects that owe him duty and gratitude; for thoſe men that hazzard their lives freely in deſperate ſervices, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ayme at victory or conqueſt, by which they intend to purchaſe gaine or glory, which enflames their blouds with continuall agitation, that ſcarce gives leaſure to reflect upon the dangers, much leſſe time for cold and apprehenſive conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and yet we ſee ſuch have for the moſt part need of noyſe of drums and ſound of Trumpets to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:98927:295"/>waken their courages, or lay aſleep their feares, to continue them better in action, whereas ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath nothing to helpe or comfort it, ſince the minde is ſtill prepared to entertaine the miſery it ſuſtaineth, with a pale expectation of the ſame or worſe, when as I ſay it is known it muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured without hope, having no diverſion: like a perſon ſick in the night, wanting objects of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, thinks that ſeaſon longer and his torment greater by much then in the day time; for where the minde is kept high by ambition to compaſſe ſomething it coveteth, it hath power enough in that interim to hold up the body from falling to its proper center the earth, where naturally it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines: but being without comfort, if a man doe not make ſtrong uſe of his noble part his ſoul, to maintaine his courage and reſolution, the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or captivating of fleſh and bloud, will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a man quickly totally overcome, and that is the reaſon that long and tedious perſecutions have deſtroyed more competent ſpirits, then ſharp and violent tortures, ſince they were prepared for the one with expectation, and only weared by the other with continuance. We know that old men ſtrive more greedily to preſerve their lives that ſhort time they are to live, then young men in their moſt flouriſhing yeares; becauſe diverſity of proſpects operates ſo much in youth full boſomes, by reaſon of continuall activity, tending that way, that they have not leaſure to ſettle their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon horrid apprehenſion; when old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſo much time to think (wanting power of action) that the object which is naturall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:98927:295"/>often before their eyes to fright them, and ſo fares it with a perſon that only ſuffers, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him that doth both ſuffer and act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: wherefore that perſon hath need of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage, becauſe there is nothing to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany his thoughts of variety or diverſion; for certainly it pleaſeth a man rather to contend for his life, though he know he ſhall be deprived of it, then to loſe it without any ſtrife at all; which ſeemes to be the caſe of <hi>Euarchus,</hi> ſince they will not ſo much as permit him with reaſon to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his rights, but force him unheard to deliver up his Crowne: and more grievous a great deale is his condition, in that he appeares to be left of all thoſe friends that have been moſt obliged to his goodneſſe. What is the reaſon that a delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent upon the Scaffold is accuſtomed to have his eyes banded before the ſtroake of death, to take away from him the apprehenſion of the blow which he knowes he ſhall receive? When a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Souldier in the Field without ſhaddow will charge againſt a thouſand weapons, with as much certainty of deſtruction, but becauſe the ones acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on frees him from the others terrour: All which ſhew, that a ſad expectation of an ill, augments the ſuffering, when a diverſion by imployment of the body, or buſying the ſenſes by diverſity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, take away that apprehenſion that makes any danger or miſery exceſſively horrid; as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, men for the moſt part are put to torture in uncouth places, where there is nothing but ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or low whiſpers, to render the ſufferer more ſenſible of the paine, by the quieting of the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:98927:296"/>and ſo it fares with ſuch as paſſe through darke places, being afraid of every ſmall ruſtle, when in the day time, the ſame way perhaps is pleaſant; ſo that as I ſay without doubt, all ſmart, griefe, and diſcontent is encreaſed by want of action and too much leaſure for conſideration; for I muſt conclude, that it is a great deale eaſier for a perſon to dye fighting in the Field, though he ſhould be cut in ſunder in a thouſand pieces, then to endure a long and tedious captivity, which is <hi>Euarchus</hi> preſent condition; in ſo much as at laſt if he ſhould in ſome ſort yield to this cruelty, I muſt not finde fault with his courage, but if he gaine the victory, I ſhall eſteeme him a miracle of nature.</p>
                  <p>As I muſt not ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> goe about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove your arguments grounded upon ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and more delivered by the knowne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your excellent judgement, ſo of the other ſide, I could wiſh the King had ſome Counſell to aſſiſt him in theſe difficulties beſides his own ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and courage, ſince it is impoſſible but hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature at the length will be tired with over much ſuffering, and by conſequence faile for want of true information: there is no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of your opinion ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> but ſuch is the crafty ſpight of ſome, that they will permit none to be about the Kings perſon that dares loyally afford him any profitable conſolation, becauſe they may the ſooner bring him to conſent to their deſires: Yet replyed <hi>Roxana,</hi> it is not well known what thoſe deſires are, ſince they never durſt for all I could ever learne, publickly declare their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:98927:296"/>but doe as it were in a dark miſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to poſſeſſe the people, that the King refuſeth ſomething he is obliged to grant for the good of his Subjects; by which meanes they ſtrive ſtill to maintaine their credits and opinions amongſt the common ſort. It is ſo Madam ſaid <hi>Creſes;</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince you are fallen upon that point, I ſhall let you know, how farre the King hath yet condiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to their demands, whereby the better to diſpoſſeſſe the People of that beliefe they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to have in the Senates integrity, though I verily thinke, they now more feare their power, then truſt their intentions; for whereas not many dayes agoe, they propoſed to <hi>Euarchus</hi> to have the power of the force of the Kingdome for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares both by Sea and Land, the King hath yielded to grant them that juriſdiction during his life, though not for that terme, which appears now to be the greateſt difference between them, ſince the Senate ſeemes not content with this offer: whereupon the <hi>Myſſians</hi> have lately put our a furious declaration againſt the Senate preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the King to ſuch unreaſonable conditions: In good earneſt anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> I cannot tell, whether I have more cauſe to ſmile at the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ridiculouſneſſe of theſe proceedings, or be amazed to ſee men growne ſo fooliſhly unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſince <hi>Euarchus</hi> appeares to my underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to be willing to part with more from his own hopes, then what the Senate requires; for that if he grant the power of the Kingdome out of his hands during his life, it gives more aſſurance to the Senate that he intends no more to raigne,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:98927:297"/>if he had quitted his power for ſo many yeares only, ſince he might have ſome thought to over live that preſcribed terme; againe for the <hi>Myſſians</hi> I wonder moſt of all at their new loyalty to their Prince, when they have been as I may ſay, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe that hath made him no King, though now anew, they ſeeme to deſire to re-eſtabliſh him in his ancient authority, which certainly cannot be but upon other deſignes of advantage to themſelves, more then for <hi>Euarchus</hi> proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>Truly Madam ſaid <hi>Creſes,</hi> in the generall it is as you ſay, but yet there are ſo many myſteries hid under theſe proceedings, that they are capable to deceive the ſharpeſt judgement, if ſome light be not given by information: Wherefore you muſt know that both <hi>Euarchus</hi> and the Senate know very well, that the conſequence of all the Affaires, chiefly depend upon the aſſurance of the ſafety of the Kings perſon, ſince he cannever hope to be againe re-eſtabliſhed in his rightfull authority, but either by the humours and inconſtancy of the common people, who when they finde the Kings absolute oppreſſion brings no proſperity to them, will probably become exaſperated againſt the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates proceedings and power, or by an unrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable difference betweene the Senators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who may moſt command when they ſhall ſinde no other juriſdiction to oppoſe them: both which in all likelihood will conduce to the Kings benefit, if he ſit quiet ſometime under his inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which I conceive to be the reaſon that he hath in outward appearance yielded ſo much to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:98927:297"/>their demands. And for the <hi>Myſſians</hi> perhaps by this oppoſition they would perſwade the world to a beliefe of their integrities, as if at the firſt they couſented not to the Kings hard uſage, whereby to obtaine a greater party, not only in the Kingdome of <hi>Lydia,</hi> if they have an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to diſpute their own profit: but in other Countries if they meane to make Warre upon our people, becauſe they cannot be ſharers in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as they hoped, the only cauſe certainly of the now ſeeming quarrell; ſo that in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>Euarchus</hi> hath done like a wiſe and politick Prince, in ſeeming not to contend, where he was ſure not to prevaile, eſpecially ſince by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, he might have endangered thoſe hearts that will now be of his ſide, if the occaſion be offered, either out of pitty to his ſufferings, or out of hate to the Senates government; And beſides, it is to be conſidered, that no act he ſhall paſſe in this condition of conſtraint, can binde either himſelfe or poſterity by all humane and divine lawes, if his Sword ever become more powerfull: in the meane time, the Senate will ſeek to preſerve the Kings life and perſon with their beſt care, ſince their own authority falls entirely by his death, which as I ſay is the reaſon they deſire more a terme of yeares in the continuation of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired government, then the determinable fate of the Princes life, becauſe they may have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the liberty to preſſe him to new conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if they finde by experience they have notyet obtained ſufficient, ſince they ſhall not need to feare the vexations of his perſon, may bring any hazard upon him.</p>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:98927:298"/>
                  <p>I cannot deny ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> but theſe reaſons are ſufficient to render me wholly ſatisfied in my doubtfull opinions, but the gods are only capable to foreſee the event of things. And with that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon the Sun, ſhe perceived the time of the day called her to the attendance of the Princeſſe, which made her for the preſent take her leave. Upon her arrivall ſhe found <hi>Cloria</hi> only accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by her Late in a ſmall withdrawing room belonging to her own chamber, where none but her ſelfe had permiſſion to be admitted: not long after ſhe had ſaluted the Princeſſe, ſhe diſcovered ſhe had been weeping, by the red circles about her eyes, that gave the old woman occaſion fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be inquiſitive after her imployment; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhe ſpyed this complaining ditty lying written before her upon the Table, that quickly gave her ſatisfaction of the occaſion, though her excellent voyce and rare skill rendred the Muſick heavenly.</p>

                  <p>But the Princeſſe after ſhe had made an end of her Muſicke, began with many complaints and more ſighes to blame abſent <hi>Narciſſus</hi> for his too much negligence in his love, ſince in all this time of her laſt reſtraint he had not found as ſhe ſaid ſome diſguiſe to viſit her perſon, though he might want the power to procure her liberty; which ſhe continued with a certaine paſſion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till <hi>Roxana</hi> not only chid her for thoſe ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, that as ſhe told her had deſtroyed in part the raviſhing delight of her ſong, but ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in accuſing her ſervant, that had in ſo many dangerous adventures ſhewed alwayes the entire conſtancy of his affection, who was no doubt at
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:98927:299"/>the preſent retired into ſome region, where he might beſt advantage her ſervice. However <hi>Cloria</hi> was willing upon any hopes, to be ſatisfied with the proceedings of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> and much more with his intentions; yet could ſhe not but tell <hi>Roxana,</hi> that although ſhe was pleaſed to be his advocate that ſeemed to have a powerfull perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in her beliefe, yet were the loves ſhe feared from <hi>Farezius,</hi> and the importunities ſhe expected of <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> in her apprehenſion, arguments ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make her think <hi>Narciſſus</hi> wanted much diligence, at leaſtwiſe violence, that he did not endeavour to ſcale the very Walles where ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a priſoner, rather then to endure her to be ſo injured. Truly Madam anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> as I cannot tell why you ſhould expect miracles inſtead of ſervices, ſo have you no cauſe to doubt the importunities you mention, ſince I am not certaine <hi>Farezius</hi> love was ever preſented to your liking: either from himſelfe, or any of his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; And for the Addreſſes of <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> you have been already ſo accuſtomed to refuſals, that I conceive you have not any other hard part to play then to continue the ſame courſe ſtill. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, you may well remember by <hi>Caſſianus</hi> own Letter, that his affections are not ſo hot, as to preſſe you upon over great inconveniences; and therefore, in my opinion you may very well quiet your thoughts concerning his courtſhips.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, you are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in both theſe particulars, for as to my knowledge (which I have underſtood ſince I ſaw you laſt) <hi>Farezius</hi> hath already intimated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:98927:299"/>to my father, whom you may be ſure will comply almoſt in any thing that concernes the Generall, So doth <hi>Caſſianus</hi> labour the Senate underhand, to be propitious to his love, ſince as he ſayes, their own honours are ingaged in the iſſue, for that the world takes notice of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations, which are to ſee him eſtabliſhed in a proſperous condition both in power and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And the rather as he pretends for that they formerly ſent for him, according to their profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſee them put in execution. <hi>Roxana</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, as there be many reaſons of ſufficient force to make me give way to your opinions, ſince your own beauty, honour, and vertues are loadſtones attractive enough to intangle all the world in an intricate labyrinth of love and deſire, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what difficulties ſoever, yet it cannot but ſeeme moſt ſtrange to my thoughts, that <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rezius</hi> low condition, though his fortune hath been eminent, ſhould aſpire to ſuch a ſupreame excellency with any hope to enjoy. Hold your ſelfe content woman ſaid the Princeſſe, there is no limitation of ſelfe-love and ambition, when they have once taken poſſeſſion of a proud heart, though covered with never ſo meane an extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; And you know that <hi>Farezius</hi> is a gentleman, which joyned with his former ſucceſſe in the Warres, and his preſent command now in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, cannot want perſwafions to make him at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any enterprize for his own glory, eſpecially ſince the King ſeemes meerly to depend upon his aſſiſtance, or allowance for his future proſperity; and being ſo, what counſell can you give me ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:98927:300"/>to prevent his violence or inſiruct his paſſion, ſince I dare not be too bold, in hazarding my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fortunes by provoking the Generalls ſpleen by a harſh and diſdainefull deniall.</p>
                  <p>In good ſooth ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> I am very glad to ſee, you have learned ſome temper ſince you were in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Oſiris,</hi> where as you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, I had much adoe to perſwade you to entertaine reaſon, or continue you in patience, wiſhing then, you had hazarded a thouſand deaths rather then have diſſembled your love in any kinde; but perhaps <hi>Narciſſus</hi> is now farther from your remembrance, though neerer your perſon. No by all the immortall gods anſwered the ſweet Princeſſe, my affection is as pure and conſtant as it was in <hi>Oſiris</hi> Court, if not encreaſed by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of more tryalls to render it abſolutely judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, only the conſideration of my fathers preſent captivity, and future danger makes me ſo farre willing to diſpence with my own deare love, as to maske it over with ſome hypocriſie, for his ſake, which formerly I was unwilling to purchaſe with the aſſurance of my own life, when I remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the City of <hi>Memphis;</hi> only the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a neceſſarily jealouſie in <hi>Narciſſus</hi> breaſt, when rumours ſhall bring ſuch reports to his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eares, I muſt confeſſe ſomething deterres my reſolution, from any diſſimulation at all in love, though no way prejudicially to his right or my own honour.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Madam ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> I doe not now only, begin to love you for your wiſdome, but will endeavour to put a project into your head,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:98927:300"/>that may both keep your father ſafe, and perhaps deſtroy your enemies, at leaſtwiſe it will protract if not divert your violent proſecution; certainly governeſſe anſwered the Princeſſe, if you prove as good as your word, I ſhall eſteeme it the greateſt piece of ſervice that ever your wits produced, ſince in my opinion, it not only equalls all others in benefit, for that the King as well as my ſelfe is concerned in the buſineſſe, but out goes the reſt in difficulty, conſidering how many powerfull adverſaries you have to deale withall. Well then ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> ſit ſtill and heare my propoſitions, and afterwards prepare your ſelfe without reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to put them in execution, though never ſo much againſt your appetite; if not returne me ſuch arguments as may convert my judgement as well as ſatisfie your own fancy: <hi>Cloria</hi> told <hi>Roxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> that her injunction was ſo reaſonable, that it was not to be contradicted by any that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, or was not deſperate againſt their own good, promiſing withall to be punctuall in her obedience, as a principall duty ſhe eſteemed her ſelfe bound unto, in regard of that charge ſhe had had ever ſince her infancy over her, and then the old woman began this diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>For theſe two Suitors ſaid ſhe, that ſeem like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to trouble your patience, and the Kingdomes quiet, ſince the one commands the Army, as the other is poſſeſt of the hearts of the Senate, I make no doubt, but you may oppoſe their owne intereſt one againſt the other, if you can diſſemblingly but entertaine the love of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; by which jealouſie certainly there muſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:98927:301"/>needes riſe diſcontents and factions towards your ſafety and fathers advantage; for if you entertain the addreſſes of <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> the Souldiers will think their Generall undervalued, who appeares now to the publike view to carry upon the point of his Sword the abſolute power and ſtrength of the whole Kingdome; And if you accept of <hi>Farezius</hi> Courtſhips, no doubt but the Senate will eſteeme their own authorities diſhonoured, ſince they have propoſed Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> to be the ſubject of their chiefe care: Beſides, if <hi>Farezius</hi> ſhould faile in any thing he attempts, many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people would conceive with ſome violence, that the Senate hath an intention to couzen them o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t of thoſe priviledges, they have been promiſed when their greateſt patron ſhall be debarred of his own deſires, and if <hi>Caſſianus</hi> ſhould miſſe of what he hath hitherto expected by the Senates liberall offers, the Nobility might very well imagine, that the people and Army endeavoured to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their Maſters, which would not be leſſened by other jealouſies already growing between the two factions, ſince the Nobility doth not onely with all the ſecret policy they can, ſeek to curbe the inſolency of the common ſort, who ſtrive for nothing more, then to bring down all dignity to an univerſall equallity, but the multitude have already ſo farre declared their diſlike of the Lords proceedings, that publikely they have required to have the authority of their juriſdiction taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and made lyable to the peoples allowance, who now enjoy their priviledges by inheritance from their Anceſtors, purchaſed either by their
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:98927:301"/>own merits, or the Princes grace. And laſt of all, though the factions of the two Rivalls ſhould not enflame at the particular diſgrace of either <hi>Caſſianus</hi> or <hi>Farezins,</hi> yet certainly their owne Swords in a private combate would be very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to decide the quarrell, which would give you a faire pretence to refuſe the Survivor that ſhould covet to imbrace you with hands imbrued in bloud.</p>
                  <p>Governeſſe anſwered the Princeſſe, although I ſhould be very glad to be an occaſion to raiſe any faction for my own preſent advantage, and my fathers future proſperity, yet I cannot deny but I am moſt extream ſorry to heare of new troubles, whereby the Kingdome ſhould be engaged in more ſlaughters. You are very pittifull replyed <hi>Roxana,</hi> but I pray conſider, whether it be not better to procure the diſcompoſure of thoſe that have ſought all this time by their authority to eſtabliſh another government, deſtructive to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, whereby of neceſſity a generall confuſion muſt follow, for that it is not probable ſo many intereſts can be ſatisfied, or give occaſion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <hi>Lydia</hi> for the conqueſt of forraigne Forces, ſince it is impoſſible your fathers many children would be content to ſit downe quietly with the perpetuall loſſe of their owne Birth-rights extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the King by his unruly Subjects, during their minorities, and able enough certainly they will be to contend for their dues, ſeeing all the Princes of <hi>Aſia</hi> are intereſſed as well in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as in their bloud. No, no Madam ſaid ſhe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpence with your unprofitable commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:98927:302"/>then be careleſſe of future ſafety, for it will be much better now to deſtroy theſe unlawfull deſignes by a little civill Warres amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that would but parge the Kingdome of its corrupt humours, ingendred by exceſſe in pride and proſperity, then in the times to come to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all conditions to a perpetuall ſlavery, under a Tyrannicall government, gained by the power of lawleſſe Souldiers, brought in by other Princes not acquainted with the natures of our people, much leſſe ſenſible of their ſufferings, ſince they will only conſider their faults paſt, and not looke upon their miſeries preſent, for they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judge them by the manner of ſubjection of their own Countrey, then by the ſweetneſſe of the <hi>Lydian</hi> Lawes: Wherefore I ſay you muſt thinke, whether of the two Saitors you will make the object of your choyce, to render the other jealous of his actions and your favours, whereby ſome ſudden difference may ariſe between the factions to bring the ſooner confuſion into the Kingdome, which certainly is the readieſt way againe to eſtabliſh your father in his right, ſince the noyſe of forraigne power at preſent, will not only be an occaſion the better to unite them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Kings diſadvantage, but at the beſt, hazard the deſtruction of all property and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, ſince the Sword will be the principall Arbitrator of every mans right, and the victory a change of his condition.</p>
                  <p>Truly <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, as I cannot in my own reaſon eſteeme your diſcourſe apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall, ſo of the other ſide, you cannot deny, but
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:98927:302"/>that I have been ever willing in all my neceſſities to follow your Counſell, and therefore ſince you have preſcribed the Law; certainly the election will be eaſie; for conſidering that <hi>Farezius</hi> hath not yet publikely pretended to my love, at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by any expreſſions to my ſelfe, me thinks it would appeare ſome injuſtice for me to refuſe <hi>Caſſianus</hi> Courtſhips, who hath already as you know a kinde of an ingagement from my own mouth concerning the old <hi>Flamine,</hi> though he be ſince deſtroyed: beſides his bloud, Titles, and condition, more ſuite with my honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, in which the Nobility of the Kingdome will have the greater ſhare, whoſe dignities cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if it were not for particular ends, would preſerve Monarchy; whereas the people and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers endeavour nothing more then to deſtroy it from the face of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Why then Princeſſe ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> if you be ſo reſolved, I muſt give you your leſſon; but firſt <hi>I</hi> will tell you of a third Suitor, who alſo as beſt deſerving muſt have ſome imployment, and that is <hi>Creſes;</hi> one whoſe affection might merit a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall with your love, if your other engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his own diſproportion were not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles beyond removall: however, it is your part to truſt his fidelity, and reward his truſt, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince his endeavours may bring you advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as well as himſelfe preferment. Wherefore I will deſigne him to this office though he be not yet privy to my intentions, which is preſently to make a Journey into <hi>Syria,</hi> where the Queene your Mother, and the Prince your brother both
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:98927:303"/>remaine, to expect the pleaſure of that State con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your fathers affaires, by which meanes he ſhall more particularly be able to informe them concerning the Myſtery of your reſolutions that may render the aſſiſtance they ſhall be willing to lend more advantageable, and the rather for that I underſtand the Countrey of <hi>Syria,</hi> ſtill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaines an Ambaſſadour with the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> whoſe force certainly will conduce much to our projects, if they can be made faithfull to <hi>Euar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> good, ſince the leaſt power will infinitely ſtrengthen the faction that ſhall ſhew it ſelfe for the King or his ſonne; and in the Journey I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend <hi>Creſes</hi> ſhall viſit the <hi>Cretans</hi> ſee whether they may alſo be wrought to Joyne with our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty here at home, which is not improbable, ſince peace and ſettlement in <hi>Lydia</hi> will be an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to their proſperities, for that thoſe people by this Kingdome are eſteemed no other then pernitions rebells: And let <hi>Creſes</hi> alone to act his part when he is ſufficiently enformed of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, whoſe ſharpe wit and excellent language, cannot be equalled by any meſſenger can be ſent, which are fortunate properties to our purpoſe; beſides his intire love to your ſacred ſelfe, will be alwayes ſure to continue him abſolutely faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, which afterward muſt be rewarded, either by your fathers fortunes, or the Queenes intereſt in <hi>Syria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Without doubt Governeſſe ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> you have hit upon a right plot, and the rather for that I heare by a late edict ſent from the Senate (as it ſhould ſeeme upon the Kings flight) they have not
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:98927:303"/>onely baniſhed out of the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> all my fathers friends in generall, but <hi>Creſes</hi> in particular, as conceiving him extraordinarily intereſſed in the Kings counſell and affaires, for that he brought as you know to the Senate the firſt propoſitions of his and the Armies deſires.</p>
                  <p>Then Madam ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> your next worke muſt be, anew to invite Prince <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> by ſome hopes of your acceptance of his offered Love, which may conveniently be grounded upon the late Letter he ſent you, that you have not yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, as alſo upon your diſcourſe to him, when he ſhewed both affection and diligence in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the old <hi>Flamines</hi> life at your requeſt, in which ſervice you expreſt ſo much liking to his perſon and vertues, that you profeſt him the next perſon in your thoughts to <hi>Narciſſus</hi> engagement, whom he will not be perſwaded is living: and I ſhall be very glad ſtill to continue him in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, untill the deſignes we have in hand may happily be brought to ſome fortunate Iſſue, by which meanes <hi>Farezius</hi> may be ſpoyled of the peoples affections, and bereaved of the power of the Army, that now ſeemes to carry him up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other authorities, and ſo conſequently enflames his thoughts above oppoſition, in what he ſhall propoſe, much leſſe wiſh; though truly for my part I believe, he hath a ſtrong faction againſt him, not only by the Nobility by reaſon of <hi>Dimogoras</hi> diſgrace, and many of the chiefe Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators fearing their own power, but alſo in divers Provinces where he hath ſo long a ſpace quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Souldiers without removall, though their
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:98927:304"/>own deſires in taking away the power from the Lords and deſtroying the Kings regality, yet hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them from complaining.</p>
                  <p>Well, well ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> as we muſt leave time to diſcover theſe hidden myſteries, ſo will I addreſſe my ſelfe to put in execution what your wiſdome hath preſcribed, and to that purpoſe muſt enjoyn you to remaine here in my abſence, untill an houres ſpace give you releaſement; in which inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim I ſhall endeavour to contrive a Letter to <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> (in anſwer to his he ſent me the other day) convenient for our deſigne. But ſcarce had the Princeſſe remained in her private Cabinet the time limitted by her words, but ſhe brought forth a Letter imprinted in a faire character, but writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a much fairer hand, which ſhe giving to <hi>Roxana</hi> to reade, it ſpake this language.</p>

                  <p>The Princeſſe could not chuſe but reade this Letter with a little kind of trembling, as if ſhe
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:98927:305"/>feared what ſhe did not doubt, ſince the worſt ſhe was to expect, as ſhe thought from <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> was to comply with her deſire; but it is the nature of all paſſion, to produce new violences, whether in thoſe things we wiſh or others we would not have. And ſo it fared with ſweet <hi>Cloria,</hi> who in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dreaded what ſhe had deſigned to be, becauſe it came. But after a lovely ſmile had taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that countenance, that for a while put on ſome diſtraction, ſhe told her governeſſe, that although their plot in all apparance had thus far well ſucceeded, ſince ſhe perceived her Couſin was wonne to be ſufliciently valiant; yet ſhe made ſome queſtion how ſhe was to entertaine his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when he ſhould make his addreſſes; for if ſhe ſhould as ſhe ſaid, give him but ordinary wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, he might againe fall back from his ſeeming fury againſt <hi>Farezius;</hi> and if too well, he might expect ſome greater engagement then was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for her to grant. Truly Madam anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> make no ſcruple to let him have as much as you can ſpare upon the old ſcore, ſince my Lord <hi>Narciſſus</hi> appearance at any time, will ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely blot outthe obligation, which you know were the firſt conditions you treated upon in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the old <hi>Flamines</hi> life. I but ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> I ſhould be very ſorry any ſuſpected teſtimony did remaine, that ſo much as intimated my thoughts could ever be perſwaded to another choyce. In good ſooth ſaid the old woman; your conſcience is ſo tender in matters of love, that I believe when you are married to your ſervant, you will make a doubt, whether he be the ſame man or no, and by
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:98927:306"/>that meanes call your affection in queſtion to the raiſing of ſome deſperate jealouſie between you. At theſe words the Princeſſe ſmil'd, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in her reply, by the information ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that her dinner waited her pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>It was not long after this diſcourſe before <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſianus</hi> himſelfe in perſon came into the Princeſſe Lodgings, not only in confirmation of the truth of his Letter he had ſent, but as it were according to his profeſſion to obraide <hi>Farezius</hi> ſuſpected, if not pretended love, although <hi>Cloria</hi> for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, was ſo buſied by reaſon of ſome imployment in her chamber with her maid ſervants, that <hi>Roxana</hi> was conſtrained with ſome complements not only to give him entertainment, but to make her Miſtreſſes excuſe, which at laſt ſeated them both in a withdrawing roome belonging to the Princeſſes lodgings, and that conveniences drew on many diſcourſes; amongſt which <hi>Caſſianus</hi> was perſwaded by the old womans deſires, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the paſſages of his own fortunes, with the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Armenia,</hi> pretended to be injured by the uſurped power of <hi>Artaxes</hi> their great King, which he delivered in this manner, as a greater motive by <hi>Roxana's</hi> meanes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade <hi>Clorias</hi> affections.</p>
                  <p>You muſt know ſaid he, that after the valiant King of <hi>Scythia</hi> had loſt his life in the <hi>Armenian</hi> Warres in defence of the Princes rights, who were eſteemed oppreſſed by <hi>Artaxes</hi> power, a ſtory moſt ſufficiently known to all, my ſelfe came into <hi>Lydia</hi> to demand aſſiſtance of <hi>Euarchus</hi> my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to recover againe my conquered Country of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:98927:306"/>
                     <hi>Iberia,</hi> detained from me by <hi>Tigranes</hi> Duke of <hi>Colchis. Orſames</hi> alſo at the ſame time began his Warres againſt our oppreſſor with the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, ſince <hi>Philoſtros</hi> his powerfull Favourite judged it a worke full of piety and juſtice, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he knew there would be much bloud ſpilt in the quarrell, ſince as his maſter was mighty, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxes</hi> was obſtinate, and both ambitious; And to this purpoſe, not onely proſecuted his deſigne with much violence againſt the King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> but in a ſhort time <hi>Orſames</hi> gained many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, ſo that at laſt, he brought <hi>Artaxes</hi> to be willing to accept, if not to demand a publike Treaty; whereby as twas pretended, <hi>Aſia</hi> againe might be reduced to its former happy condition, by the effects of a generall peace, ſince the diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of ſuch mighty intereſts, ſeemed to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the whole world with a fatall deſtruction; and to this effect, all the injured Princes were called to ſhew forth their accuſtomed priviledges, in a City upon the Confines of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> which was a place choſen as moſt indifferent for that effect: where their Commiſſioners then mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and yet remaining with more diſputes, then hopes of agreements, gave occaſion to the Senate of <hi>Lydia,</hi> to invite me to flye to their protection, as well for preſent ſubſiſtance, as future hopes, ſince it appeared theſe two powerfull Kings, only beheld their own ambitions as the chiefe object of their conſiderations, though they pretend a more charitable intention in their actions. But my Lord ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> as I doe not deſire to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my thoughts with the rights of other Princes
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:98927:307"/>that have little relation to our affaires, but as they may concerne your particular, ſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard they may prove over tedious for our inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded diſcourſe, ſince the Princeſſe her ſelfe will be likely to ſurprize us before we have finiſhed, I muſt intreat the honour only to be made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with thoſe things, that ſhall belong to your owne Titles; and the rather for that I have heard ſome diſputes formerly to that purpoſe, which I was not very well able to anſwer, and ſhould be very glad to be better provided againſt other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the ſame nature.</p>
                  <p>Truly Madam anſwered <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to ſever in all reſpects the intereſts of other Princes from my own, ſo I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to avoid what unneceſſary diſcourſe may prove either tedious or impertinent; after that <hi>Roxana</hi> had acknowledged the favour by a few complements, he related theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Although I am confident ſaid he, that you are competently informed, that my dead father was diſpoſſeſſed of his fruitfull Countrey of <hi>Iberia</hi> for taking up of Armes againſt the power of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> yet may not be perhaps ſufficiently inſtructed how <hi>Tygranes</hi> became poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of our Countries, Titles, and Honours, wherefore be pleaſed to know, that after my ſaid father was driven forcibly from the poſſeſſion of the Crowne of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> (which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the free election of that people, who found themſelves oppreſſed by the Lawes <hi>Artaxes</hi> had impoſed upon their conſciences; as well as many of the Nobility deprived of ſuch Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:98927:307"/>to the Temples, in their poſſeſſions, which their predeceſſors had leſt them, though formerly taken away I muſt confeſſe by violence from the <hi>Flamines</hi>) and my mother forced to flye to her friends charity for ſuccour and ſafety, the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Tygranes</hi> riches, proſecuted ſo farre his begun good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that in a ſhort ſpace he not only quieted the ſtirres in his dominions, but advanced his power into <hi>Iberia,</hi> which being without any ſupport, but what few Forces <hi>Euarchus</hi> his father, then King of <hi>Lydia</hi> had ſend to defend his daughters right, quickly became maſter of what ſtrong pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he pleaſed, untill at laſt he was Lord of the whole; and being in poſſeſſion he not only paid that debt he owed to <hi>Tygranes</hi> with part of my Lands, but beſtowed upon him in requitall of his other good ſervices, all our Titles and honours which for many laſting ages had remained in our family, as being the next of kinne. As this cruell injuſtice killed my father with griefe, ſo after ſome yeares it brought to our aſſiſtance the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Scythian</hi> Prince, as one ſent from the Gods in our apprehenſion, to teach <hi>Artaxes</hi> a new law of obedience to the fortunes of ſo great a courage; however this date of life became determined by the envious deſtinies, and we left only to demand ayde of <hi>Orſames</hi> power, to finiſh that work that we thought ſo happily begun to the advantage of the injured Princes; in which number I was to be reckoned the chiefe, ſince moſt eminent both in wrongs and honours: As I may ſay my particular cauſe bearing the very name of all the reſt: In this
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:98927:308"/>ſigne, the <hi>Syrians</hi> continued a large progreſſe within <hi>Artaxes</hi> Countries, untill the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was forced in a manner by the conſent alſo of <hi>Soraſtros</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to that generall trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I formerly mentioned; which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all the while hath only produced diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inſtead of concluſions, for that the War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſtill with violence to the ruine of the whole Kingdome, without the benefit of any in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, began at firſt by the obſtinate pride of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>granes,</hi> that would not reſtore thoſe rights belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to my ſelfe, which probably might have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſatisfaction to the other Princes of our facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; however lately <hi>Tygranes</hi> being alſo oppreſſed by the burthen of warre in his owne dominions, begins to be more plyant to our deſires, and to this purpoſe many arguments are alleadged of either ſide to give colour to the unfortunate acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Souldiers, who are maintained more to ſatisfie the ambition of the two mighty Kings, then to put us in poſſeſſion of our rights. <hi>Tygranes</hi> affirmeth, that as the King of <hi>Armenias</hi> gratitude beſtowed upon him in recompence of his ſervices done the Crowne, thoſe honours and Lands that belonged to our Family, ſo the money he hath laid out in the Warres, makes him a lawfull pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer of that benefit; and therefore in all equity cannot be deprived of them without a full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, according to the damage he hath ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thoſe actions. The State of <hi>Syria</hi> againe pretends, that unleſſe my ſelfe be reſtored to my former dignities, the combination which is made with the injured Princes, muſt of neceſſity be
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:98927:308"/>broken, and ſo conſequently their Kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> diſhonoured in their agreement; and we further adde, that although <hi>Artaxes</hi> might have ſome colour of diſpleaſure againſt my father, for taking upon him the Crowne of <hi>Meſopotami'a,</hi> and defending the poſſeſſion in his life time by force of Arms, which however is a Title diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet my ſelf ought not to be eſteemed any way guilty of the fault being an infant; and therefore too much injured by ſuch a loſſe, when inſtead of enjoying the greateſt principallity of all <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia</hi> for dignity, I am left naked of honour and ſubſiſtance, whilſt others of leſſe quality triumph with thoſe ſpoyles that ſhould adorn my perſon. In concluſion, not to detaine your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation over long with diverſity of relations, although the Kingdome of <hi>Syria</hi> vowes never to lay downe Armes without a full reſtoration of the Princes rights: yet many Miniſters of that State did underhand conclude a league with <hi>Tygranes</hi> to my prejudice; which ſhewes particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt hath the chiefe preheminency in this Warre; but ſince, upon new breaches, the Duke again is fallen off from that agreement: in ſo much as the difference may produce better effects; and the rather doe I hope it, for that <hi>Tygranes</hi> hath lately offered to procure the King of <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to grant me equall honours to thoſe my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath loſt, as himſelfe will be content to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up the poſſeſſion of the Countries belonging to my right, if a generall peace in all <hi>Aſia</hi> may by that meanes ſucceed; provided he be compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently ſatisfied by the State for thoſe damages he
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:98927:309"/>hath ſuſteined by the Warres; in which poſture continue our preſent affaires; without either moving backward or forward, to the amazement of the whole world.</p>
                  <p>Truly my Lord anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> it ſeemes to me, nothing more is demanded in the Kingdome of <hi>Armenia</hi> then what you have been pleaſed to mention, ſince your intereſt is the baſes, upon which the only occaſion of the Warre hath been builded. It is true ſaid <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> however ſome differences in points of religion that the <hi>Scythians</hi> ſtand upon, is a kinde of an obſtacle alſo; yet it is thought, the State of <hi>Syria</hi> can when it pleaſeth, moderate that particular: but the truth is, that thoſe contentions that depend upon <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> are of ſo much conſequence to this Treaty, that it abſolutely hinders not only the progreſſe, but ſucceſſe of all the reſt, whoſe ambitions as 'tis thought can never be ſatisfied; untill one of thoſe States periſh from its appearing greatneſſe; by which meanes the other may appeare to the world more abſolute.</p>
                  <p>By this time the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> came into the roome, which for the preſent not only broake off their diſcourſe, but gave warning to <hi>Caſſianus</hi> to preſent himſelfe to his moſt glorious Miſtreſſe, as the chiefeſt deity his heart pretended to adore; however, ſhe, as if nature as well as art had taught a more beſeeming quickneſſe then ordinary, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with thoſe inſtructions ſhe had received from her Governeſſe that gave her confidence, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her kinſmans addreſſes with theſe words:</p>
                  <p>Couſin ſaid ſhe, if my neceſſary imployment
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:98927:309"/>hath made me ſeem rude in that entertainment your kinde viſit merited from me, I muſt deſire you, rather to interpret my omiſſion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption I had in thoſe tyes that have united us in bloud, then any fault my governeſſe hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in my education, upon which ſcore I am bold to aske your pardon, for your over long ſtay in expecting my company. <hi>Caſſianus</hi> finding himſelfe ſaluted in this manner, not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to cuſtome, but his own expectation, ſince formerly all her diſcourſes were rather markes of civility, then teſtimonies of affection; ſtood ſome time amazed, as if his imagination could not be ſatisfied in that truth which his eares heard utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; But after he had a little put off that pleaſing diſtraction that anew captivated his ſenſes, though in a trembling poſture, he returned her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Truly Madam ſaid he, if the greateſt Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in the world had been ſo bountifully repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for whole ages of attendance upon ſo beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a goddeſſe, certainly he would have made no queſtion of his ſatisfaction, but rather have given his whole domination of the earth for ſuch a purchaſe; much leſſe muſt I eſteem my ſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured that only live by your pleaſure. O my Lord anſwered the Princeſſe, ſince your expreſſions flye ſo high a pitch, I ſhall begin to think it neceſſary to defend my reputation againſt your comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but yet upon better conſideration, I am of opinion it is much ſafer to confeſſe my ſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by your courteſie, then venture more blowes in ſo unequall a combate, where your wit
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:98927:310"/>will be ſure to have the victory: And with theſe words taking him by the hand ſhe led him into a faire Balcony that had a large proſpect over the goodly Rive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        </gap>le,</hi> where long they had not remained (the Princeſſe in the meane time caſting her eyes downe the River, upon whoſe bankes was ſeated that pleaſant houſe of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that firſt gave <hi>Caſſianus</hi> entertainment when he came into <hi>Lydia</hi>) before ſhe uſed this language, though a ſweet ſhower of teares opened the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for her words: I cannot ſaid ſhe but with ſome griefe remember the innocent times that gave both you and me meeting in yonder place, when my Father ſeemed to triumph in glory, that is now unfortunately metamorphoſed into a Garriſon of Souldiers, who perchance neither honour dignity, nor know goodneſſe, much leſſe practiſe vertue.</p>
                  <p>Indeed ſaid <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> as I muſt confeſſe thoſe reſpects I then received from your moſt noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and my affectionate Uncle were farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my poore deſerts, which gives me more oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion at preſent to lament his condition, in being Subject to ſuch a cruelty, that no power of mine is able to redeem, yet I cannot alſo but remember my own loſſes at that time, ſince even then I quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the liberty of my ſoule, that untill this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I could never recover againe; though I have ſought all wayes of redemption; and unleſſe you prove more mercifull then the Kings oppreſſors, I ſhall not only remaine in as great a captivity, but have cauſe to accuſe you of the like Tyranny, though I dare not be ſo bold in my complaints.</p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:98927:310"/>
                  <p>But yet Couſin ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> I muſt make a great deal of difference in the nature of your ſufferings, though I ſhould grant the quality; for as the King hath by all meanes poſſible ſtrived to give his oppreſſors ſatisfaction, provided it may not be againſt the right of his Succeſſors, and good of his people; ſo you of the other ſide violently ayme at your own content, to the injuring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of anothers Title. Alas Madam anſwered <hi>Caſſianus,</hi> was I not your firſt and laſt lover? the ſilent rocks can give ſufficient teſtimonies of the one, when at that famous hunting, I retired under their protections, only to make my complaints, and the whole Senate can witneſſe the other: by my importunities; wherefore no intereſt is to be eſteemed equall to my pretentions, either in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or right.</p>
                  <p>Alaſſe, alaſſe anſwered the Princeſſe, you never let me know thoſe powerfull affections before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects had taken full poſſeſſion of that heart which became alſo in ſome ſort a priſoner not to be releaſed, who perhaps might as well have been your Captive, if your omiſſions had not proved moſt unfortunate to your purpoſes. And whereas you ſay, you are my laſt lover, I beſeech you doe but conſider <hi>Farezius</hi> intentions, and looke upon his actions, and you will finde both violence and power hath diſcovered a later ſceane, then what you moved in, when you ſaved the old <hi>Flamins</hi> life, ſo that I muſt tell you, that unleſſe punctually you obſerve the condition according to your former agreement, which was never to preſſe my love to any concluſion, if <hi>Narciſſus</hi> were living,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:98927:311"/>to whoſe living, to whoſe memory I muſt ſtill obſerve that decorum, I vow by the gods never to entertaine any motions from your addreſſes, much leſſe give any conſent to a future marriage; beſides you muſt performe thoſe actions that may render you capable of ſatisfaction, as my ſelfe freedome in granting; which can never be as long as the Generall hath opportunity to prevent and power to conſtraine. Wherefore in briefe, you are to ſtudy ſome oppoſition anſwerable to his greatneſſe for both our advantages, whereby the better to merit my love, as to ſhew your ſelfe worthy the name of a Prince of ſo great an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
                  <p>Theſe diſcourſes of <hi>Cloria</hi> could not chuſe but nettle the ears of <hi>Caſſianus</hi> towards the reſolution of ſufficient ambitions; ſince hitherto he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelfe to have been over ſloathfull, as well in her love as his own honour; ſo that ſtanding ſome time in a deep muſe, as if he intended to ſetch his determinations from his very ſoule, at laſt he broake out into this language: Moſt faire and wiſe Princeſſe ſaid he, as already I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed my beſt endeavours with the expence of my deare bloud (in which you have the deareſt intereſt) in your ſervice againſt the proud Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; ſo I muſt be preſcribed by your directions to ſuch limitations and performances as I am to obſerve for feare, that elſe my actions may either endanger your ſafety to be more valued then the worlds Empire, or ruine your Fathers hopes, whoſe ſufferings cannot be exampled. Therefore I beſeech you let me know how farre your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:98927:311"/>may travell in that journey I intend to make againſt the pride of ambitious <hi>Farezius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Couſin ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> as I ſhall leave my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes experience to treat with you about the particulars, ſo of the other ſide, I am content to give you theſe aſſurances of my affections, that after <hi>Narciſſus</hi> you ſhall have the next place in my conſideration, provided you think of my Fathers ſufferings, and be mindfull of your own honour, ſince without him I cannot give away my ſelfe, and without your reputation you are but halfe a Prince. Upon theſe conditions you ſhall find my Lodgings ever ready to entertaine your viſits, ſo they may be ſeaſonable and not ſcandalous, which I believe are favours ſufficient to nouriſh your hopes, according to thoſe expreſſions you received under my hand in that Letter, your ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neglect of my condition forced from me, which is all for the preſent I have to ſay upon this theame, unleſſe it be to adde to your conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how is it poſſible you can either reape fruits from my affection, if <hi>Farezius</hi> continue great? or what probability have you again to recover your loſt Country of <hi>Iberia,</hi> if all regality be ſuppreſt? ſince in the one his greatneſſe may perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine me to an unwilling conſent for my owne preſervation, as the other by this meanes may ſo fill <hi>Lydia</hi> with popular deſires, that your birth and bloud, much leſſe dignity ſhall finde no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in their conſiderations. Wherefore I ſay, joyn your thoughts only to ſuch deſignes as ſhall be contrived by the Nobility with the State of <hi>Syria;</hi> wherein the <hi>Myſſians</hi> ſeem alſo to
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:98927:312"/>have a ſhare, in regard the Lords governe all in their Country, and by that meanes you will beſt pleaſe my deſires.</p>
                  <p>Although <hi>Caſſianus</hi> could not diſprove the Princeſſe Rhetorick, for that it taught him a duty belonging to his quality, which he had not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto altogether followed, ſince he more looked upon his own private concernments, in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Uncles enemies, then thoſe rights that belonged to the dignity and honour of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which number himſelfe was eminent by bloud and alliance: yet in regard of thoſe hopes that <hi>Cloria</hi> gave him by her faire language, and good entertainment, he was ſufficiently pleaſed with her diſcourſe, for that it ſpake at leaſtwiſe liking, if not love to his eares: however, it ſeemed mixt with ſome reſerved conditions, which he was content only to interpret baſhfull aſſurances, though the gods were privy to other intentions, that could not be altered; wherefore as if joyfully aſſured by the Princeſſes words, and impatient of more delay to pat in execution what he was enjoyned after he had returned humble thanks not only for her free expreſſions, but the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhe had in his ſervices, with ſome other complements belonging to his love, and fit for the ſeaſon, kiſſing her faire hands he tooke his leave, yowing the abſolute performance of all her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to the uttermoſt of his power: but being gone, the Princeſſe uſed theſe words to <hi>Roxana,</hi> fearing belike her own diſſimulation was too great a crime.</p>
                  <p>Doe you believe ſaid ſhe, that the gods will be
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:98927:312"/>content with my hypocriſie, in making this poor Princes affections, a ſtale to our other purpoſes, ſince you know my vertuous engagements are ſo farre from ſuffering me to become his wife, that my heart dares ſcarce think of ſuch a perſwaſion in any kinde; and as little ſhould I be willing ſuch a report ſhould reach the eares of abſent <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus,</hi> who perhaps will accuſe my conſtancy for having only deceived, in that nature for his better advantage: no no <hi>Roxana</hi> be confident, as plaine dealing is beſt in all morall actions, ſo certainly in love the contrary procures either hate, jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or deſpaire, which may produce effects dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, if not deſtructive. After the old woman with a kind of ſmile had heard out her Miſtreſſes diſcourſe, ſhe returned her this anſwer.</p>
                  <p>As I cannot deny ſaid ſhe, but diſſimulation in it ſelfe, is a flattering vice that ſteales upon many diſpoſitions with certaine poſſible if not probable ſignes of lawfulneſſe, becauſe they are contented to be perſwaded by their imaginations, they meane no hurt in their intention, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I muſt confeſſe, deſtroyes all morall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; yet in all reſpects of the contrary, for a perſon to uncover his breaſt upon every occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without leaving himſelfe a defence againſt his crafty enemy, were a madneſſe capable to ruine his fortunes as often as the opportunity preſented the meanes. Wherefore Madam, in the generall I can only give this rule, when a body is left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty whether he will ſpeak or no, let him rather hold his peace, then ſo much as intimate a falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by his words, or in friendly converſation
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:98927:313"/>appeare not candid and ſatisfactory: but if in deepe examinations that may produce great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences either of good or hurt, for my part I am of opinion, all art poſſible may be uſed to avoyde the determination, provided a direct untruth be not admitted; or the damage of a third party ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by the concealement.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, for that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this diſcourſe for my ſatisfaction, I pray let us apply it to my caſe with my Couſin, whom you ſee I have wonne into a beliefe of what I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intend. Tis true ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> however it doth not appeare you have engaged your ſelfe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by words or actions; and therefore it is not any thing you have done hath conſtrained or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded his beliefe; wherefore it ought only to reſt upon the fault of his own fancy, if he prove deceived in his expectation hereafter. Beſides, it may be conſidered, that as he hath been ſome part of the occaſion of your ſuffering unjuſtly, ſo is it fit he ſhould endure a little pennance for that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and put caſe it may be granted that you have after a manner deluded his thoughts by the Letter you wrote him, wherein you ſeeme to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite his addreſſes to a new Courtſhip, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eſteemed falſe, for that you may have a reſolution to entertaine his affection, if my Lord <hi>Narciſſus</hi> (whom the Gods defend) ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earry. I but there Governeſſe, replyed <hi>Cloria</hi> lyes hidden the deceit, ſince my reſolutions are fixed never to make any other choyce in life or death. Why then anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> at the worſt you doe but like an honeſt perſon in danger to be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:98927:313"/>that takes ſome liberty to make thieves fall out, whereby to be the better ſecured: And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Caſſianus</hi> cannot be prejudiced by the practice, but on the contrary reape benefit, for that his fortunes ſeem to depend upon regallity and Nobility, which the rude multitude would deſtroy; I ſee no reaſon why you ſhould poſſeſſe your thoughts with ſuch ſcruples. Well, well ſaid the Princeſſe, as you are my Governeſſe, in this doubt I will perſwade my conſcience to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your principles; however, the gods may puniſh us both for our over-much boldneſſe, thus to play too freely with thoſe injunctions that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne religion; or at leaſtwiſe may have ſome relation to it; however, I cannot deny, but that there is a neceſſity in my diſſimulation at this preſent; and the rather am I content a little to practice the faculty, for that I know <hi>Caſſianus</hi> can ſuſtaine no prejudice by my intentions.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding theſe and other reaſons which <hi>Roxana</hi> uſed at divers times, proved ſufficient motives to retaine her miſtreſſe firme in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their deſignes; yet underſtanding by <hi>Creſes</hi> amongſt other diſcourſes, that the Duke of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi> was dead, ſhe could not in ſome ſort but be doubtfull of the ſafety of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> for that they had heard nothing from him ſince his ſeparation; however, ſhe was extreamly carefull to keep theſe thoughts from entering into the boſome of the already too much troubled Princeſſe, though in the interim ſhe omitted no opportunity whereby to inſtruct <hi>Caſſianus</hi> in that part he was to play by their appointment againſt <hi>Farezius.</hi>

                     <hi>Caſſianus</hi> as I ſaid, having received both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from <hi>Cloria,</hi> and inſtructions by <hi>Roxana,</hi> conſulted oftentimes with himſelfe as well as with her how he might beſt put them in execution, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at laſt he fell upon this reſolution; that as <hi>Dimogoras</hi> his truſty friend, had been moſt injun'd by the preferment of <hi>Farezius,</hi> having outed him of his place and command in the Army, ſo would he be the fitteſt perſon to be communicated with all, concerning the like lieſt way to proſecute his deſignes, according to the directions he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: To this effect he intended to make him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the hopes he had lately received to obtaine the favour of the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> in his pretended love; The rather for that he knew he was not only a man who had a principall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt among the Nobility and chiefe Senators, but was alſo extreamly beloved in the Army, by moſt of the common Souldiers, that were not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute creatures of <hi>Farezius:</hi> wherefore one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning before <hi>Dimogoras</hi> was gone out of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Caſſianus</hi> came unto him with a ſmiling countenance, and this language in his mouth: <hi>Dimogoras</hi> ſaid he, as it were ſomething imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent againe for me, to reiterate the multitude of my obligations to your endeavours, ſince they are not only generally knowne to all the world, but divers times have been acknowledged by my expreſſions in particular: ſo my buſineſſe at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is to make you acquainted anew, both with my thoughts and intentions concerning ſome late paſſages: I came into <hi>Lydia</hi> as you know by your procurement to proſecute my affections to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:98927:314"/>the faire Princeſſe the Kings daughter when ſhe was taken priſoner by the Senates Fleet in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game.</hi> Tis true my courtſhips in that nature, were ſomething retarded, if not abſulutely laid aſide untill the preſent, by reaſon of a certaine correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency between her, and <hi>Narciſſus</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cyprus</hi> ſonne: This gives me occaſion to tell you, that however I found her then backward to my wiſhes; either proceeding from her flattering fancy that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was living, or conceiving her own condition was much more ſecure in the Senates cuſtody, then at preſent under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Army and Souldiers, or rather I may ſay being violently preſt to ſome inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, by reaſon of the extraordinary greatneſſe, (both in command and authority) of <hi>Farezius,</hi> who as it ſhould ſeem pretends ſomething vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to her love and affection; Now ſhe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more tractable, and willing to entertaine thoſe proteſtations of mine, whoſe effect I have ever conſecrated to her ſervice, ſince I had the honour to be entertained by the good will of the <hi>Lydian</hi> people: I need not trouble you much with the reperitions of your own received injuries by reaſon of the generalls greatneſſe, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all thoſe gallant ſervices, which you have performed, in the defence and ſafety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, neither ſhall I mention the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereby, that threaten a kind of deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all the Nobility of the Kingdome; for that I know your judgement, and their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, cannot poſſibly be wanting in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: only I muſt needs tell you that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe

Are the Nobility ſaid he of <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſo much degenerated in their ſoules and ſpirits, as eaſily in this manner to quit their honour, to the loweſt conditions the people ſhall direct? what is become of the magnanimity of mind, once ſo frequently raigning in the breaſts of the better fort of men in this Kingdome, that is now loſt in a chaos of confuſion with the rabble or common multitude? doth a little ſenſuall feare, bury all conſiderations of valour and gallantry in this Nation? people being only given to eate and drinke, without affectation of greatneſſe or appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of diſgrace: If it be ſo my Lord in the generall, my words will be as much in vaine to be uttered, as your life in effect will be miſerable in the future: but I have more confidence in the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Dimogoras,</hi> both for his own ſake and my good: This being ſaid, <hi>Caſſianus</hi> reſted ſilent to heare what reply <hi>Dimogoras</hi> would make.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Caſſianus</hi> was glad he had got thus much from his reſolutions (for notwithſtanding he did not at all doubt his affection, yet he might have ſome cauſe to ſuſpect his activity) ſo that he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe alſo, to uſe the beſt intereſt he had,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:98927:316"/>both with the Lords and the reſt of the Senators, whom he knew to be of a contrary faction to <hi>Farezius:</hi> withall he had upon all occaſions free admittance into the Princeſſes lodgings, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to her own allowance and <hi>Roxana's</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which as it may be thought, ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented his apprehenſion.</p>
                  <p>It was not long before <hi>Dimogoras</hi> and the reſt of the Nobility, raiſed conſiderable factions and mutinies in the Army, amongſt the Souldiers, they alſo being enflamed by their want of pay, and not performance of other conditions promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them upon their firſt taking up Armes againſt the King, being ſince renewed againe to their hopes, when he was delivered out of priſon, by ſome Troopes ſent to that purpoſe, which ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly called away both <hi>Farezius</hi> and <hi>Hercrombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to the appeaſing of the ſtirs.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Farezius,</hi> did with faire language and promiſing words in a ſhort ſpeech, ſeemingly pacifie moſt of their diſcontents, yet <hi>Hercombrotus,</hi> who was of a more violent and active nature, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding many of the Troopes continue ſtill their mutinies, and inſolencies againſt their command, ſuddenly flew in amongſt thoſe Souldiers with fury in his looks, and terrour in his countenance, where preſently ſeizing upon two or three of thoſe that appeared moſt refractory and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, he delivered them inſtantly over to officers to be executed and puniſhed: After this he not only offered a free pardon to the reſt, but alſo promiſed them a reall performance of all their juſt expectations, provided that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:98927:316"/>they would continue obedient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in their affections.</p>
                  <p>After this, when both <hi>Farezius</hi> and <hi>Hercrom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> were on their way againe towards the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> an officer of the Army began this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to his Generall: Sir ſaid he, by this late mutiny, you may ſee the danger not only of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogoras</hi> intereſt amongſt the Souldiers, but the power he hath with thoſe of the better ſort of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators; from which originall, I ſuppoſe, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in part theſe now appeaſed troubles in the Campe: of the other ſide can you poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that after ſo many teſtimonies of diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from <hi>Euarchus</hi> the King, he will be ever brought to be either entire for the Souldiers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or be weaned from that affection without reaſon, he hath alwayes expreſſed to be in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for his falſe and ungratefull country men the <hi>Myſſians?</hi> in like manner, with what confidence can we any more truſt the actions of the wealthy City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> when as they did not only refuſe, to open their purſes to our occaſions in our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt neceſſities, but denyed us enterance into their Towne, by the perſwaſion of thoſe Senators that we have now ſent to baniſhment? Theſe things being granted to be true, the next conſideration ought to be had of the remedy for future preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: In the firſt place, to compaſſe our deſignes, and procure our ſecurity, we muſt endeavour to joyne with a prevailing party in the Senate, or at leaſtwiſe make them ſo by the Souldiers power, who may paſſe an abſolute decree, to have no more Treaties with the King, in regard that thoſe
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:98927:317"/>hopes and feares, doe not a little diſtract the whole Kingdome, from relying abſolutely upon our commands and juriſdiction, as you know moſt neceſſary for the peoples ſafety: in the next place we are totally to ſuppreſſe the intereſt of <hi>Dimogo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> for the preſent, and the Nobillities priviledges in the future, which as I muſt tell you keep up ſuch an opinion amongſt all ſorts of people, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their greatneſſe and ſtabillity, that it will be a very difficult matter, to act any thing either for the Kingdomes good or the Armies advantage: Laſtly, we muſt not only drive the <hi>Myſſian</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners out of our Country, who only wait occaſions to ſuck up all the benefit to themſelves and Nation, which the <hi>Lydians</hi> at any time ſhall either fight or toyle for, but in ſome terrifying way or other procure money from the Citizens of <hi>Sardis,</hi> whereby to give juſt and fitting content to thoſe faithfull and loving Souldiers, that have fought ſo many bloudy Battels, and obtained multitudes of ſignall victories in their Countreyes behalfe, againſt their numerous enemies.</p>
                  <p>Though <hi>Farezius</hi> by reaſon of his melancholly and ſilent nature, made no great reply at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to thoſe reaſons that had been delivered, yet it was not many dayes after their arrivall at <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,</hi> before an abſolute decree paſſed the Senate, that not only there ſhould be no more Treaties, or addreſſes made unto <hi>Euarchus,</hi> concerning any agreement either in the generall or particular, but it was alſo ordered, that it ſhould be eſteemed a crime of a moſt high conſequence, for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo much as to make tender of any propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:98927:317"/>to that effect, to the reſt of the Senators there aſſembled: which reſolution was quickly pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed over the whole Kingdome of <hi>Lydia</hi> by a formall proclamation.</p>
                  <p>Of the other ſide <hi>Dimogoras</hi> finding, both his intereſt in the Army and his credit with the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did not any way ſuit with his ambition and expectation, upon the very apprehenſion (as twas thought) of theſe apparant diſgraces, in a very few dayes ended his life in this world; however there were ſome that not only gave it out, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that he had been poyſoned, to prevent a farther trouble and danger to the Kingdome: This alſo gave occaſion to Prince <hi>Caſſianus</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a very ſhort time after, to quit perſonally the Country of <hi>Lydia,</hi> as perhaps ſuppoſing, now his chiefe friend and Favourite <hi>Dimogoras</hi> was gone, and the reſt of the Lords not being in a capacity to ſupport his honour and deſignes, againſt the Souldiers, in the Princeſſe <hi>Clorias</hi> behalfe, it was to little purpoſe any longer to proſecute his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended love.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſſe the Nobillity, with many other of the Senators of the ſame faction, prepared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to give the body of <hi>Dimogoras,</hi> moſt ſtately and glorious Funerals: To this intent, when the day came, all attired in black, they met the corps with a world of ceremony, and ſo conducted it through a multitude of people, to the place or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for that purpoſe, where being placed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of other Generalls, the flames quickly conſumed the pyles whilſt that which was immortall, had a farther account to

                  <p>When the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> underſtood of this ſtrange and unexpected law, not only pronounced in the Senate, but publiſhed all over the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſhe began now to repent her, of her too much beliefe given to the Kings enemies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any perſwaſion whatſoever, ſhe had entertained in her thoughts; and conſequently had more cauſe a great deale to doubt her owne ſecurity, having no other defence left her but what ſhe could gather from the faithfull and wiſe Councells of her intruſted governeſſe <hi>Roxana,</hi> which was the occaſion, that one day having for the moſt part ſpent her whole ſtore of paſſion, ſhe uſed this kinde of deſpairing diſcourſe unto her.</p>
                  <p>Truly <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid ſhe, as there might be noted at firſt, a ſtrong jealouſie amongſt the Souldiers, by the ſtrict gard ſet upon the Kings perſon, ſo this laſt action makes me feare, that there is ſome prevailing deſigne, as well againſt our liberties as his dominion, which we ſhall be ſcarce able to prevent by any induſtry or aſſiſtance; for as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rely much upon the Lords power, by reaſon they have altogether loſt their authority, by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their intereſts at the firſt from their Princes prerogative, nothing but to comply with their own ambition and ſpleen; ſo is there as little to be hoped for, from the endeavours of this great and rich City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> conſidering their late carriages, when <hi>Farezius</hi> with his triumphant Army, not only entered their Walls without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but were content to receive his abſolute
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:98927:318"/>commands, without the leaſt diſpute, belonging to their long enjoyed priviledges, never as yet queſtioned by any former Prince or power; theſe repreſentations being knowne and granted to be the effects of the late tranſactions, what probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties remaine, for the recovery of my fathers rights, though it ſhould be opinionated, that we our ſelves were out of all danger perſonally; ſince the Kings party appears, not to have either abillity or will to doe him good; And <hi>Lydia</hi> being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united under the preſent juriſdiction, what forraigne induſtry and endeavour ſoever, can worke any conſiderable effects to his advantage? conſidering the many brave Veſſels and ſhipping that are alwayes ready for defence and reſiſtance, upon the <hi>Carian</hi> and <hi>Ionian</hi> ſhoares, to oppoſe either ſudden invaſion or continued hoſtility.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Roxana</hi> had for ſome time reſted ſilent with teares in her eyes, ſhe returned her this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: Lady ſaid ſhe, you muſt then give me leave to blame your ſuperſtitious modeſty (as I may call it) in not ſuffering your Uncle <hi>Orſames</hi> to have performed thoſe ceremonies belonging to your Nuptials at <hi>Memphis;</hi> which perhaps in part if not totally, would have prevented theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences.</p>

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:98927:319"/>my ſelfe to any love whatſoever, without their inward conſent and publike approbation: but let us for the preſent leave that ſubject, and only fall upon the conſideration, or the meanes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the King may be redeemed from his miſeries, which Rhetorick would not only farre better pleaſe my eares, but be a much more profitable diſcourſe in my opinion, ſince in the other point, I am reſolved ſtill to remaine obſtinate, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any perſwaſion to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Truly ſaid <hi>Roxana,</hi> as I muſt needs confeſſe, the thing it ſelfe is difficult to bring about and the wayes more uncertaine to know how; ſo of the other ſide, I am ſo farre from believing the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of the Kings reſtoration to his ancient dignity, that according to my owne thoughts I ſhall give you very probable reaſons, whereby to perſwade you to it, if my fancy doth not much outgoe my judgement.</p>
                  <p>For although I cannot deny, but that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Lydia</hi> being throughly united under a well ſetled government, with the addition of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Caria,</hi> that afford ſo many conſiderable havens, furniſhed with multitude of ſhipping, is a condition ſcarce to be attempted by any power; yet conſidering the impatience of the peoples na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with the daily oppreſſions of them by the heavy weight of Taxations, a quick diviſion will be wrought in the hearts of thoſe, that muſt of neceſſity be wonne to the change of lawes, and government before the ancient conſtitutions (by which the Subjects have formerly lived happily for ſo many ages) can be totally taken away:
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:98927:319"/>However for the preſent, perhaps either feare or hope exerciſes ſo farre mens thoughts, that hardly as yet have they leaſure for conſideration: but when as, I ſay, they ſhall finde this is like to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, they will with much violence deſire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine their old ſubjection, though at firſt they were fooliſhly perſwaded to ſeeke a new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And more eſpecially if thoſe two great Monarchs of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Aegypt</hi> once make that accord, that all <hi>Aſia</hi> attends with a greedy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, which may ſoon be effected, ſince the King of <hi>Armenia</hi> hath already agreed with his diſcontented Princes, and alſo hath condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give ſatisfaction to the <hi>Scythian</hi> Crowne, whereby to deliver his Countrey abſolutely from that power, that hath ſo many yeares moleſted it with its armes.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Roxana</hi> ſaid the Princeſſe, what will thoſe agreements conduce to my fathers benefit, when every Prince regards only his own concernments? beſides their extreame jealouſie of one anothers glory will not ſuffer them to undertake any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt joyntly: And put caſe they ſhould accord conſtantly in their purpoſes, yet when the people of <hi>Lydia</hi> ſhall ſee themſelves ready to be invaded by a forraigne power, they will certainly more ſtrongly conforme their obediences, to this juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction they now live under, whereby the better to prevent a new threatning danger.</p>
                  <p>It is true ſaid <hi>Roxana</hi> untill the Subjects be made more deſperate in their ſufferings, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will not be content to truſt ſtrangers with their liberty; but yet the aſſiſtance that is deſired
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:98927:320"/>from forraigne Princes needs not to conſiſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in numerous Armies, but in ſmall and frequent ſupplies both of men and moneyes, which joyned with the Kings party, and laying hold of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcontents already ingendred in the hearts of moſt, cannot but conduce exceedingly to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of this new government. Beſides there is another benefit that may be expected from other Countreyes, being at open difference with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of <hi>Lydia;</hi> and that is, denying their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants the liberty of Trade within their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which at laſt muſt of neceſſity diſcontent and impoveriſh the rich City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> from whence the Souldiers are (if not mainteined) at leaſtwiſe ſupplyed upon all urgent occaſions.</p>
                  <p>But why anſwered <hi>Cloria</hi> may not theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and eſpecially the two great Monarchs of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> as well forbid the free commerce you ſpeak of in the time of their own differences, as when they ſhall be at peace between themſelves, if they have any intention to right my father, as I have heard they doe pretend?</p>
                  <p>Becauſe, replyed <hi>Roxana,</hi> they are both ſo full of their own ambition, that neither dares offend the State of <hi>Lydia</hi> as yet, untill their Warres be at an end between themſelves, leaſt they might give too much advantage to each other by the aſſiſtance of ſo powerfull a Kingdome as this is.</p>
                  <p>Then ſaid the Princeſſe, there may be ſome hopes to better my fathers affaires, when theſe Kings ſhall thinke it good to put up their bloudy ſwords, and not before.</p>
                  <p>I conclude not ſo Madam, anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:98927:320"/>for although theſe exaſperated Princes againſt their own quiet ſhould have neither temper in their actions, nor finde wiſedome in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours, untill meere neceſſity ſhould conſtraine their Subjects to ſeek peace with violence, which were too dangerous a preſident; yet it is to be hoped that the <hi>Myſſians</hi> with the <hi>Cretan</hi> Forces joyned to the diſcontents of <hi>Lydia,</hi> by reaſon of diverſity of Religions and intereſts would in time reſtore the King to his ancient dignity.</p>
                  <p>Piſh <hi>Roxana,</hi> replyed <hi>Cloria;</hi> for the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> I have ſo little confidence in their aſſiſtance, that what countenance ſoever their actions put on, I can ſcarce be perſwaded of their intentions, ſince they once ſold my father to this miſery he now undergoes; when they had a gallant Army in the Field to have redeemed both his perſon, and his Crowne; And for the <hi>Cretans,</hi> beſides that they are of a different profeſſion to ours concerning the worſhip of the gods; there are alſo ſo many factions amongſt them by way of private ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they rather goe backe daily in their own affaires, then ſhew any probability of helping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; And for the diſcontents of <hi>Lydia</hi> which you mention, with their diverſities of Religions, I doe not finde upon all occaſions, but they can very well lay downe their own ſpleenes, when there appears a neceſſity to oppoſe my fathers proſperity: Laſtly, concerning the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſufferings, I am perſwaded, they are reſolved to endure any ſubjection, or almoſt bondage it ſelfe, rather then to be willing the King ſhould recover againe his loſt rights, by force and power
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:98927:321"/>of the ſword, without making firſt ſome conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with his prerogative, notwithſtanding he hath divers times, given them by proteſtations, what aſſurances could be deſired from a juſt, and a religious Prince.</p>
                  <p>Madam, anſwered <hi>Roxana,</hi> your opinion I muſt confeſſe is grounded upon a great deale of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billity, conſidering how the <hi>Myſſians</hi> not onely ſold the King to the power of the Senate, but at the firſt beginning of theſe troubles came into <hi>Lydia</hi> to diſpute your fathers rights: But yet if you pleaſe to conſider, that the reaſon of their actions then proceeded from the extreame cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe of ſome eminent perſons amongſt them who finde now they can expect no more gaine (the Senate having already compaſſed their ends upon them) you will eaſily believe, that they are reſolved to change the ſceane for your fathers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſince by that meanes they may come to play a double game, and winne by the bargaine: Next concerning the <hi>Cretans</hi> although I muſt confeſſe their fooliſh diviſions amongſt themſelves have not only much hindred the Kings affaires, and in a manner indangered the whole frame of their own deſignes, yet is there ſuch a diſparity betweene them, and the people of <hi>Lydia,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the difference of Religion, but in that we have outed them formerly of much of their Lands; that they will dye to the laſt man, rather then ſuffer the Senate to beare rule over them: Thirdly, I muſt deſire you not to dwell too ſtrictly upon your beliefe, that the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Lydia</hi> will ſo eaſily accord their difference,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:98927:321"/>and pacifie their diſcontents, upon the appearance of a ſtrange Army; in regard it will only bring with it the right of the cauſe, with a promiſe of amendment; eſpecially when they ſhall by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more experience finde, that their preſent grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances have neither termination nor limitation; For I ſay, that as at the firſt they were perſwaded to entertaine the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Myſſians,</hi> whom they moſt hated, and feared of all other Nations, againſt their King, who oppreſſed them in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, however their fancies did injure their judgements, ſo will they as well accept of any forraigne aſſiſtance againſt the Senate, when they can no longer endure the burthen of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: And laſt of all give me leave to tell you, that the diviſions within the Army and Senate houſe, cannot but produce ſtrange effects, ſince no ſpleen is ſo great, as what is in gendred by the ſame faction, when once they fall at odds, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reaſon of gaine or prerogative: But as ſhe was further proceeding in her diſcourſe, the dwarfe enformed them, that there was newly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Caſtle hall a young Maid of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent beauty, who deſired with much earneſtneſſe, to be brought preſently into the Princeſſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as pretending ſhe had ſome ſecret to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, not convenient to be imparted to any other eare; he alſo ſaid, that as her eyes ſparkled forth a kinde of youthfull Majeſty, ſo did her neglectfull dreſſe, ſeeme to have been diſordred by her late journey, which made her appeare more <hi>Amazon</hi> like.</p>
                  <p>This ſtrange advertiſement put them both into
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:98927:322"/>a ſollicitous conſideration, as well concerning the perſon of the party, as the occaſion of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; And many loving deſires would gladly have perſwaded poor <hi>Cloria,</hi> that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> had borrowed another diſguize, to have given her a new viſit: but having more exactly examined her little ſervant concerning all particulars, ſhe found the ſtranger neither in ſtature or countenance could agree with the proportion or features of her abſent Lord: Wherefore after ſome more diſpleaſing conſideration, with a kinde of a ſad voyce, as if her thoughts were troubled at the miſtake, ſhe commanded the Page to conduct the Maid to her preſence.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the damoſell entred the room, with confidence enough, approaching neerer to the Princeſſe in an abrupt manner, told her though ſoftly in her eare, that her new gueſt was no other but her brother <hi>Aſcanius</hi> broake from his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment under the Senates juriſdiction; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wiſht her for ſome time to diſcharge her dwarfe, that he might more freely diſcourſe to her his advantures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cloria</hi> was ſo much confounded with a ſudden joy, to have her ſweet brother in her poſſeſſion, whom ſhe could not be permitted to ſee during their impriſonment; that her diſtractions could ſcarce finde a way, to put in execution, what her owne judgement, ſhould have thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at another ſeaſon: But at laſt breaking through her pleaſant amazement, ſhe diſcharged her little officer; for however ſhe was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to truſt him in her own ſecrets, yet ſhe would
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:98927:322"/>not notwithſtanding uſe any priviledge to hazard her brothers confidence, leaſt it might render him leſſe aſſured of his ſafety: When ſhe had paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately demonſtrated his welcome, by many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate kiſſes, taking his white hand in hers, which ſeemed alſo to have a neere aliance in beauty, ſhe deſired him to make her acquainted with the paſſages of his eſcape, ſince as ſhe ſaid, they could not but be admirable, conſidering the ſtrict guard the Senate was ever accuſtomed to ſet over the Kings children; in the interim <hi>Roxana</hi> curiouſly attended to underſtand the diſcourſe that was to proceed from ſuch dainty lips.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore after <hi>Aſcanius</hi> had ſaluted his ſiſters looks, with three or foure gentle ſmiles, in which he ſeemed lovely to congratulate his own fortune and deride his Goalers careleſneſſe, he began this repetition, though firſt he excuſed himſelfe, for many circumſtances belonging to the ſtory.</p>
                  <p>My father ſaid he, as he had commanded my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince <hi>Arethuſius</hi> for his better ſafty, into the Kingdome of <hi>Syria,</hi> there to attend the directions of our noble mother, ſo was he perſwaded by the <hi>Myſſians</hi> (in whoſe power he then remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Army) to get me into his own poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby the better to ſecure (as they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) as many as might be of the bloud royall; To this purpoſe he commanded me to make an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and preſently to repaire to his preſence; however with this caution, that if I ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in the execution, I muſt not by any meanes reveale his deſire; leaſt the <hi>Myſſians</hi> ſhould be brought into ſuſpition, who were then treating
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:98927:323"/>with the Senate about their payment.</p>
                  <p>But be their pretences what they would, I ſtrengthened my duty and obedience, by all the thoughts my young yeares and leſſe diſcretion could ſuggeſt, advantageable to the deſigne and the Kings command, which I muſt tell you ſcarce gave ſleep to my eyes in the night, or reſt to my body in the day, ſince truly I muſt needs ſay, my youthfull ambition became more violent then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, to doe ſomething exactly that might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to care and wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>Yet not to trouble you with long repetitions, where the ſucceſſe proved unfortunate. I was to my intollerable griefe taken in my eſcape, though more perplexed I muſt confeſſe, to be foyled in my firſt interprize, then ſorrowfull at the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the loſſe: being apprehended I was by order of the Senate, exactly examined before ſuch Commiſſioners, as their gravities ordained to be judges of my actions: However the gods ſo farre favoured my weake conſtancy, that neither tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nor flattery, was able to ſhake my dutifull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which ſo inraged their froward ſpleens, that they not only cauſed me to be ſhut up in a darke roome, but commanded ſome ſlight pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be inflicted upon my perſon, as a ſmall conibatant in my fathers quarrell, at which I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laughed then ſeemed to feele: But not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding theſe petty ſufferings could prevaile againſt my ſpirit, they ordered a great part of my dyet to be taken from me, as ſuppoſing belike my belly was eaſieſt to be conquered, when truly I never eſteemed meat the chiefe part of my conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:98927:323"/>eſpecially when I was aſſured for their own ſakes, they would afford me ſufficient to ſuſtaine nature: yet at laſt having tryed all other wayes to compaſſe their ends, without receiving any fruit from their labours, they withdrew from me thoſe accuſtomed reſpects belonging to my birth and quality, which I cannot deny, but moſt wrought upon my diſpoſition; for that I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the dignity of my parents, as alſo your ſelfe ſweet ſiſter ſuffered in the omiſſion.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, finding themſelves wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the goodneſſe of my cauſe, rather then by my courage, they began of a ſudden to change (though not the theatre) yet the manner of their action; which was not only to ſweeten their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages towards me, but alſo to tickle up my young ambition, with hopes of being their elected King. For as they ſaid, my father having totally abuſed his truſt, and my eldeſt brother <hi>Arethuſius</hi> being unkindly fled from their protection, they cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d finde none other ſo fit a perſon to undertake the government of the whole Kingdom as my ſelf, if I would but expreſſe love in my nature and be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by their Counſels, for their intentions as they proteſted were never to deſtroy Monarchy: But I being enflamed with a new rage to heare them to ſcandalize my fathers goodneſſe, &amp; go about to withdraw my duty by their intentions, I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that as my father had been much too gentle a Prince for ſuch people; ſo was their diſſimulation no more to be believed concerning my ſelfe in theſe offers, then when they proteſted to the world to make <hi>Enarchus</hi> the greateſt King of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:98927:324"/>
                     <hi>Aſia;</hi> And in the meane time had to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power deprived him of his Crowne and dignity.</p>
                  <p>This blunt and reſolute reply of mine, belike gave them no further encouragement to proceed; for telling me, I was a peviſh child, and could not be brought to underſtand my own good, they not only quitted my company, but by degrees ſuffered againe the ſtreame to returne into its right courſe, to my ſingular content; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever continued me ſtill a priſoner.</p>
                  <p>Having paſt over ſo great a ſtorme without ſhipwrack either of my own honour, or danger to my fathers affaires, I began to conceive good opinions of my judgement, and beginning like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be extreame weary of my captivity, ſince my yeares now required activity, I fell into many conſiderations of another eſcape; and had encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to put it in execution, not only by daily rumours I heard of the diſcontents of the people, for that they found no inclination of the Senate to agree with the King; but alſo, for that I underſtood many of the Kings ſhips had lately revolted from their ſervice: All which I ſay en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed my thoughts to a new deſigne, and theſe inflamations of hope, deſire, and paſſion, made me diligent to procure the good opinion of thoſe that were intruſted with my perſon, as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſequence to my intention. I oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of them to what end was it to uſe rigour in my impriſonment, when it might turn to their prejudice, if our ſide ſhould hereafter prevaile; neither could it at all benefit them for the preſent
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:98927:324"/>with their maſters by any rewards, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſtill in authority?</p>
                  <p>Theſe perſwaſions with other circumſtances, took them off from the fierceneſſe of their ſpeed, eſpecially when they had heard that <hi>Farezius</hi> was forced to ſend many of his Troops abroad, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Provinces againe to his obedience, that rather choſe to runne into deſperate dangers, then ſtill to continue under the Senates power.</p>
                  <p>Theſe encouragements I ſay, made me beginne to frame thoſe <hi>Embryons</hi> I had already conceived in my unſetled braine to ſome ſhape, proper for production; and to this purpoſe, deſcending from generals to particulars, I acquainted a ſervant I have now brought along with me, (whom I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes found faithfull to my intentions) that my reſolution was, in this diſtracted ſeaſon to gaine my liberty out of the Caſtle; and therefore wiſht him to provide for my eſcape ſuch neceſſaries as were convenient for a buſineſſe of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that concerned not only my own ſafety, but my fathers proſperity, but in the interim to colour my deſigne, I gave it out that I intended to ſolemnize the birth day of my brother, by a publike Maske, to be acted for the delight of thoſe Souldiers of my guard: When the night came (having all the afternoon before filled their brains with the fumes of excellent Wine, as their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with the expectation of the ſtory of <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> flying from the ill natured rage of his cruell father) after they were all orderly placed in their ſeates, I cauſed the ſceane to be diſcovered, which appeared to their view of ſo taking a quality,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:98927:325"/>that they had no leaſure at all to attend their charge, ſo that I had liberty ſufficient by their willing or careleſſe neglect, to paſſe divers times without my accuſtomed attendants, through the Galleries into my private bed chamber, as preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I had ſome neceſſary office in the Play; but at laſt finding they were all either ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in their imployment of curioſity, or paſt conſideration by reaſon of their over liberall diet, I more ſecretly retired into my Cabinet, where I had appointed my ſervant to attend with womans apparell: which robes being ſoon fitted to my perſon, ſo well ſuited with my imagination, that I carried my ſelfe with much confidence amongſt the multitudes of company in every room, when I came into the common hall, my ſervant uſhered me as ſome Maſquer to the doore; where the Porter made no difficulty to give us paſſage, as believing it was a neceſſary duty belonging to his office, not to be at all jealous in ſuch joviality, leaſt his fellowes might have derided him for his ridiculous caution.</p>
                  <p>But however, I got thus proſperouſly from the danger of all the Courts of guard, yet the laſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell either bitten with his ſervile attendance in the open aire, whilſt his other companions in warme roomes enjoyed content, or being by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture more ſuſpitious then the reſt of his fellowes, began ſtrictly, not only to examine our intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but roughly to deny our paſſage, in ſo much as my ſervant not believing it was ſafe to admit of ſuch a hazardable contention, quickly drew out a ſhort hanger he had by his ſide, and gave
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98927:325"/>him a blow upon the pate, that made him aske counſell of the ground for the reſt of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, whether the wound was mortall or no, we left him only to conſider, whilſt we made our paſſage, free in the night ſeaſon, through a thick wood not farre diſtant from the Caſtle, untill the breaking of the morning, conſtrained us to ſeeke refuge in a darke cave, where we continued all the next day for feare of diſcovery, ſince we doubted not, but my flight would ſoon be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with open cry.</p>
                  <p>When the skie began againe to be obſcured for our advantage after the going downe of the Sun, we thought it beſt to take a new journey towards the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> where confuſion we ſuppoſed would ſecure us, untill we could finde a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient tranſportation for <hi>Syria;</hi> however our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe, &amp; want of food compelled me the next day about noone, to take up my habitation in a ſmall Cottage under a hill ſide, in whoſe dwelling there only remained an old man with his wife, having between them as the fruits of their long marriage one daughter, which by the way muſt occaſion a pretty ſhort ſtory: We no ſooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the houſe, but being provoked by a ſufficient appetite, we called for ſuch proviſion as they had, promiſing a large payment, and they as willingly condiſcended to our deſires, in which office the maid ſeemed moſt diligent, not only in regard of her own good huſwifery, but being exceedingly delighted, as might be gathered by her ſmiling countenance at my ſtrange attire; in the houſe there was but two beds, the one where the old
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:98927:326"/>people lay, and the other for the young wench; ſo that I was to take up my reſt neceſſarily in the Girles bed, where I muſt confeſſe, I ſlept to my content, whilſt my attendant made uſe of a bundle of ſtraw in an out houſe for his lodging: but in the morning I might feele, not only one in bed with me, but the party to have her hand over my breaſt, whom by more conſideration I found to be the young damoſell of the Cottage; This I muſt confeſſe put me to ſome confuſion, untill by a ſtrict examination of her intention, I perceived it was only her own innocent curioſity, becauſe ſhe thought me a fine young gentlewoman: At which relation the Princeſſe could not chuſe but laugh; the rather for that <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> did with ſomething a conſtrained earneſtneſſe, ſtrive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the wenches chaſtity, as if he had been jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous alſo of his own honour: yet nevertheleſſe he was ſorced to confeſſe, the Maid did much queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, becauſe he had no greater breaſts; But having ſufficiently cleared his repatation, and jeſted out the reſt, he againe continued his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>Although ſaid he, I had ſufficiently ſatisfied her in all queſtions concerning my travels, yet I had much adoe to perſwade her to riſe from me; ſo much was ſhe in love with my company, neither would ſhe condiſcend to my requeſt untill ſhe had againe imbraced me, beſtowing three or foure of her kiſſes upon my lips; This being performed, and having yawned a pretty ſpace, as a teſtimony of her youthfull lazineſſe, ſhe ſuddenly ſtarted out of the bed in her ſmock, that was not of the fineſt
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:98927:326"/>cloath, where ſhe remained ſtill diſcourſing with me untill her father, and mother lying in the lower roome, gave her a call or two to haſten her ſpeed, yet I had opportunity enough to enquire of her, not only the neereſt way to <hi>Sardis,</hi> but of the conveniency of the next Town, where I meant to provide my ſelfe of ſome change of apparrell, ſince I durſt not truſt thoſe, which brought me from the Caſtle.</p>

At which words with a pretty ſmile the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> caſt her eyes upon her Governeſſe, as if ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from her experience the beſt direction for them both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Roxana,</hi> when ſhe had drawne the lookes of
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:98927:327"/>
                     <hi>Aſcanius</hi> upon her in a curious manner, ſince he had not been formerly acquainted with her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and alſo muſed according to her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome for ſome ſhort ſpace, ſhe gave this advice.</p>
                  <p>Truly, ſaid ſhe, as it is moſt neceſſary in the prime place, that my Lord <hi>Aſcanius</hi> provide for his own ſecurity, ſince it is impoſſible but ſome ſpeedy ſearch will be after his eſcape, the Senate not being willing to part with ſo many of the Royal family out of their own juriſdiction; So Madam be pleaſed to thinke it convenient, that the Queen now remaining in <hi>Syria,</hi> may preſently be made acquainted with this fortunate delivery of my Lord your brother from his impriſonment by ſome truſly meſſenger to be diſpatched from our Counſels, which party may be (as I conceive) this faithfull ſervant, the companion of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, whom he hath now brought along with him into this Caſtle, who cannot well remaine here in that he will rather prove a Subject of ſuſpition then an officer of uſe, ſince the daily viſits of this place by the Nobility, and other people of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity muſt of neceſſity bring his name in queſtion. And for this beautifull runaway your brother, ſince he ſo well becomes a Maids attire, and hath ſo bravely given teſtimony of his own modeſty, I ſee no reaſon why he may not ſtill live amongſt us, without danger to his own perſon, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to our honours, being entertained as your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant in your chamber, untill either commands out of <hi>Syria</hi> call him away, or you your ſelfe be removed from the juriſdiction of this Kingdome, by your happy marriage with my Lord <hi>Narciſſus;</hi>
                     <pb n="311" facs="tcp:98927:327"/>at which words the Princeſſe became as red as Scarlet, not dreaming her young brother ſhould ſo abruptly have been made acquainted with her ſecret ingagement: But the fault was already committed, and <hi>Roxana</hi> had no time to aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe, wherefore ſomething confounded by her errour, as well as ſhe could ſhe went on with her continued diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>However ſaid ſhe, that we may not remaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of the proceedings of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, I ſhall induſtriouſly endeavour to inſtruct our little dwarfe, who wants no wit to make ſuch inquiry abroad, as may be moſt convenient for our affaires, for whoſe truth and honeſty I will undertake, with the engagement of my reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; This may give you a full liberty to enjoy with freedome each others company, a benefit that neither of you will repine at I am ſure, ſince the fates have been hitherto penurious to both your converſations; with theſe words ſhe reſted ſilent in a kinde of a grave ſmile, expecting the young couple ſhould ſigne their conſents by ſome demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>After that <hi>Roxana</hi> had fully ended her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the lovely paire looked upon each other, with ſuch a ſweet chearefulneſſe, as if their own paſſions had no deſire to enquire further after the depth of her reaſons, ſince their hearts abundantly approved of the conſequence of her deſigne, which was that they might enjoy the felicity of one anothers converſation; at laſt <hi>Cloria</hi> asked her brother, how he liked the wiſedome of her Governeſſe, which gave him occaſion to tell her,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:98927:328"/>that he did not now wonder how ſhe had paſſed through the intricacie of ſo many dangerous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, having had ſo faithfull and diſcreet a Pilot to guide her, in the vaſt ſea of ſuch deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate accidents.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time this delighted company paſt away their howers in ſuch converſation, as moſt tended to <hi>Euarchus</hi> wiſhed proſperity, ſometimes complaining of the unrelenting cruelty of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that could ſo long detaine their juſt and mercifull King in a darke priſon, inſtead of caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves at his feet humbly to deſire pardon for their offences, otherwhiles againe they would entertaine their thoughts, with new hopes of his releaſement by powerfull Armies ſent into <hi>Lydia</hi> by all the Princes of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in which number <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus</hi> had no low ranke in the opinion of love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall <hi>Cloria;</hi> neither ſeldome did they agree in beliefe, that the generall diſtractions of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, would ſoon put an end to the differences without any other aſſiſtance, untill theſe diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fancies carried them one day into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where <hi>Clorias</hi> diligent ſervant in the view of other attendants, obſerved ſo carefully the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of her charge; that ſhe made alwayes election of thoſe fruit that the Princeſſe intention did but only covet, and preſented them to be made more beautifull by the touch of her white hand.</p>
                  <p>In theſe entertainments I ſay they continued untill an ancient Lord of the Senate, who had not altogether put off his duty and affection to the Kings poſterity, with a ſeeming joy that made him forget his accuſtomed ceremonies to the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:98927:328"/>Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> not onely ſuddenly entred the Garden, but made a kind of rude paſſage through the crowd of ſuch as waited neere her perſon; and with a breathleſſe voyce informed her, that, that very morning, as the Nobility were ſitting in their own Councell chamber, divided by a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from the common aſſembly of the lower Senate, they were ſaluted in a tumultuous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by may thouſands of people (having their leaders of much greater quality) with a petition, that not onely complained of the proceedings of the Army, but deſired they might again ſpeedily enjoy the liberty of their King, the freedome of the Lawes, and an eſtabliſhment of their Religion, as they ſaid abſolutely obſtructed from their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, by the licentious power of the Souldiers under <hi>Farezius</hi> command, whom (as they inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) they had formerly choſen to be their Captaine for ſome ſeaſon, but not to be a tyrant againſt their priviledges for ever; vowing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that as they would not depart the great City of <hi>Sardis</hi> without a direct anſwer, ſo were they reſolved to procure an accompliſhment of their juſt requeſts, to the hazzard of their lives, and fortunes.</p>
                  <p>O Madam, ſaid he, how theſe brave begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, inflamed our ſoules with new courages: notwithſtanding, we could not chuſe in ſome ſort, but reflect upon our own poorneſſe of ſpirit, or at leaſtwiſe dulneſſe in underſtanding, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went about to put in execution what theſe people propound at preſent for their and our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.</p>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:98927:329"/>
                  <p>Truely, replied the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> although I cannot but commend theſe peoples underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that appeare to have ſome ſenſe and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their reputations yet muſt I a great deale more extoll their courages, that dare expoſe themſelves to maintaine thoſe ſmall priviledges, which by a certaine kind of birth-right they have received from their honeſt and wiſe ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors; when as you of the Nobility, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſeem altogether ſtupid in the apprehenſion of ſuch honourable rights that appertain to your qualities, left you by the brave endeavour of your moſt Noble predeceſſors: who were at the firſt ſo ſpleenative indiſcreet, in your paſſions againſt your Prince (though without any known cauſe whatſoever) that you were content to ſacrifice your known own advantages, above the common all people, onely that you might but deſtroy him and his prerogative; not leaving your ſelves ſo much power as to be able again to recover your own dignities.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words and reproofe of the Princeſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt put the Nobleman out of his tale; but ſhe finding him ſomething out of countenance, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him to the proſecution of his relation:</p>
                  <p>Madam, ſaid he, when we had thanked them for their prudent admonition (as we termed it) what our own duties ſhould have remembred, we preſently diſmiſſed them, with other ſpeeches and promiſes, that ſufficiently contented them for the inſtant. After they were gone, I muſt tell you, we were ſent to the other part of the Senate, ſitting in another room diſtinct from ours; intimating
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:98927:329"/>we deſired ſome conference with them, whereby the people might be rendred ſatisfied in their ſeeming juſt demands: upon our meeting, many things were propounded to that purpoſe, as well concerning our ſelves as the ſouldiers; but what will be the iſſue of theſe proccedings, for my part I am not able to divine: onely we are informed, that the multitude will not depart from the City of <hi>Sardis,</hi> untill they have received ſuch anſwer, as may in ſome ſort give content to their thoughts: which either muſt ſettle the Kingdom in a probable poſture for peace and quietneſſe, or ſo inflame the Armies reſolutions, that they will endeavour to become maſters of the whole. With theſe words he abruptly took his leave, as if his apprehenſions had been tranſported only by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary conceipts.</p>
                  <p>As ſoone as the Lord had quitted the garden, and the reſt of the attendance being alſo removed ſome diſtance from them, the Princeſſe, <hi>Aſcanius</hi> and <hi>Roxana,</hi> began to fall upon conſiderations and diſcourſes of the Kings affaires: ſometimes their hopes were carried to aſſure themſelves, that it was unpoſſible, but thoſe confuſions muſt needs produce effects to that purpoſe; ſince, as they believed, the ſouldiers of the Senate could not long agree, and then the common peoples deſires of neceſſity would again bring him into his Throne: for they imagined, that however there might be obſtacles &amp; contentions for the preſent, in regard of the extraordinary power of the army, yet the ſouldiers at the laſt could not but admit of a King, more willingly then any other
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:98927:330"/>Generall of their own ranke to command over them: beſides they doubted not, but the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> would joyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eſtabliſh <hi>Euarchus</hi> in the ſame honour and dignity as he was in before theſe late trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; ſince the conſequences had already not a little impoveriſhed the whole Kingdom, and what it would doe further if it ſhould continue, might very well be feared, though as yet not certainly known; In that the dignity of a Court probably, would as well confirme the one in their heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary priviledges, as inrich the others by traffique and commerce; ſeeing it was chiefly the better ſort of perſons, that took off the commodities of the Merchants.</p>
                  <p>Theſe pleaſant apprehenſions invited them all three to take ſome delight, in a certaine beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and refreſhing Grote, encompaſſed round about by an intricate Labyrinth, or Wilderneſs of flouriſhing Trees, that ſhaded it ſufficiently from the eyes of people: in the middeſt thereof there was a Fountaine upon the borders, in which was contrived many ſorts of Chaces by dogges and huntſmen; who by the turning of ſeverall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Cocks, ſeemed not onely to move in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their prey, but the hounds with open mouthes barked and made a noyſe. The pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the conceit, for a long ſpace gave young <hi>Aſcanius</hi> ſufficient content: when they were weary of beholding of this invention, they went to the viewing of other rarities. There they might behold <hi>Andromeda,</hi> with the Sea Monſter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the water to devoure her, whilſt her
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:98927:330"/>ſorrowfull parents ſtood upon the bordering ſhore, to behold that wofull and lamenable Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, occaſioned as they thought by the too much ſeverity and cruelty of the gods, untill <hi>Perſeus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Dane,</hi> that was courted in a ſhower of Gold by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> deſcended from the skies upon his flying horſe, and ſeemed to reſcue the diſtreſſed Lady. There were alſo to be ſeen in that place, divers Artificers, working in their Trades, onely by the force and current of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: in like manner, others playing upon ſeverall kinds of Inſtruments, both delightfull to the eare, and pleaſing to the apprehenſion. Beſides, Birds of all ſpecies, made of Glaſſe and other materials, that ſeemed to chirpe in a naturall way, though onely ſo contrived by the meere invention of men, to give the greater ſatisfaction to luxurious ſenſe. After they had as it were glutted their contemplation with theſe delightfull vanities, the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria</hi> being better skil'd then her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the uſe of ſuch devices, ſuddenly turned one of the pip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Roxana,</hi> as if ſhe thought her Miſtreſſe had uſed ſomething too much ſeverity towards her young brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:98927:331"/>a needleſſe apologie for the action, when ſhe might have known <hi>Aſcanius</hi> could not be diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at any thing his ſiſter did. When they had as it were dwelt long enough upon theſe watry pleaſures, they again returned into their own lodgings, in which place the metamorpoſed mayd was moſt carefull to obſerve thoſe decorums that belonged to her office, and attendance, leaſt the contrary might have occaſioned the endangering of his diſcovery: where they remained, I may ſay, entertaining themſelves ſometimes with hopes, and ſometimes with feares, untill the dwarfes returne brought them more certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, of many paſſages both from <hi>Sardis</hi> and other Regions: however becauſe they deſired to underſtand his information, in the moſt metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall way, in regard the circumſtances as they apprehended, would give a great light to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions on foot, they wiſht him to tell his ſtory and adventures in order, which he performed in this manner.</p>
                  <p>After ſaid he, I parted from this Caſtle, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your command I went to the very doore of the Senate-houſe, the beſt place as I thought for intelligence; where finding all thoſe that ſtood without in a moſt confuſed diſtraction, both in their words and looks, it was not long before many of the chiefe Senators, of a ſudden came out of the room; when preſently they went with a great deale of haſte towards another chamber, where I underſtood by the diſcourſes of the multitude, they were deſigned to meet ſome of the Lords about a conference, concerning the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:98927:331"/>ſettlements of the diſorders of the Kingdome. I being both bold, and little, and ſo conſequently as I thought not much to be ſuſpected, in the confuſed crowd thruſt in along with them, where placing my ſelfe in a nook of the chamber under a hanging it was my chance to heare theſe ſeverall diſcourſes from them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of Senators that ſpake, thought it convenient, if not altogether neceſſary, again to ſettle the King in his ancient dignity, not onely in regard of the extraordinary cries of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people to that purpoſe, but alſo for that there were ſo many ſeverall factions within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Senate, not probable to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, with any advantage to the Nation: Others notwithſtanding were of a contrary opinion, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging that it were better to hazard the ruine of the whole Countrey in a generall confuſion, then to come any more under the juriſdiction of that Tyrannicall government, as they ſaid they had with ſo much bloud already endeavoured to deſtroy: A third number of that aſſembly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſome ſort to be willing to reſtore againe <hi>Euarchus</hi> to his Crowne in full luſtre, but they doubted, leaſt his unrelenting ſpleen might put him on, to call the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:98927:332"/>that not only Prince <hi>Arethuſius</hi> was in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Syria,</hi> proſecuting the Queen his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſignes, and my Lord <hi>Aſcanius</hi> his brother had lately by flight procured his owne liberty without their conſents, that abſolutely beate back any more diſcourſe upon that ſubject; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they thought it convenient, if not extreame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary for the preſent, to give what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction they could to the diſcontented people, who belike attended in great numbers, about the City of <hi>Sardis</hi> to that purpoſe: yet it was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered with all, that if they ſhould endeavour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to pleaſe the multitude, without having their Swords ready drawne in their hands, whereby to be able to chaſtize them, if they ſhould prove too unreaſonable in their demands, they muſt expect dangerous and inſolent affronts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of quietneſſe and obedience to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: In ſo much as they thought it convenient in the interim that they entertained the peoples expectations, with good words and faire promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, to ſend privately to <hi>Farezius,</hi> wiſhing him to be ready to march with his Souldiers, to keep the multitude in due obedience to the Senates autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity if they ſhould continue theſe extravagant proſecutions of their deſignes, which in effect being fully reſolved upon by them all, they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broake up the Aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>So that when they were in this manner diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed and I had freed my ſelfe undiſcovered from their companies, I thought it my duty, to gaine what other intelligence I could amongſt the common people, ſince I conceived, much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:98927:334"/>of ſcandall, ſo did ſhe of the other ſide exceedingly wonder, that his own change of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which onely procured his ſafety, under the protection of the Caſtle, where for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they remained, had not wrought in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition contrary effects, to that quality wherein he was born, ſince now he was to eſteem him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe rather a ſervant to fortune, then a Prince by extraction: not a Prince, replyed <hi>Aſcanius?</hi> the gods defend, I ſhould ever harbour in my breſt ſuch poore and unworthy thoughts, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the injuſtice or malice of any fortune whatſoever: no ſiſter, be you aſſured, that both for your ſake and my own, I ſhall alwaies endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour by my actions, to ſhew that I am ſonne to <hi>Euarchus</hi> and <hi>Hyacinthia,</hi> and I doubt not but you will doe the like concerning your own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: But yet, replied the ſweet Princeſſe, we are obliged in ſome ſort to yield to our fates, when we have not means ſufficient left us to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them; for if the Senate, by a certain kind of a tyrannicall power granted them by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens (perhaps onely in correction of our offences) doe impriſon and circumſcribe our perſons, what matters of conſequence can our mindes afford us to our advantage in ſuch exigencies? O ſay not ſo, anſwered <hi>Aſcanius;</hi> for the mind is able to be a noble conquerour over all unfortunate diſaſters; ſince in my youthfull ſtudies I have read of many brave perſons, that in the higheſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of tyranny, and afflictions impoſed upon their bodies, by their worſt and greateſt enemies, have at laſt in deſpight of all their cruelty, born
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:98927:334"/>away the onely palme and Lawrell of victory; as it were confounding their very perfecutors, with the extraordinary conſtancy of their own ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Theſe, ſaid <hi>Cloria,</hi> I muſt conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſe are brave reſolutions in words, if they can be as well practiſed by actions: for I muſt tell you, that fleſh and bloud cannot eaſily put off all naturall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; though I will not deny, but the ſoule may doe miracles, being ayded by divine conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations; and oftentimes hath demonſtrated wonderfull effects, meerely out of ſome extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſenſe, or inflammation of honour, both by Souldiers and Philoſophers. Truly, ſaid <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius,</hi> then it were very hard, being Kings chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if we ſhould not in our proceedings meet with ſome of theſe faculties to our benefit; when as perhaps contemptible ſlaves in former ages have aboundantly exampled to our knowledge and edification, ſuch heroicall ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>As they were thus diſcourſing, <hi>Roxana,</hi> who had for a long ſpace kept a moſt formall and grave ſilence, thought it alſo convenient to ſhew her own wiſdome; the rather, ſince her yeeres and experience, pretended to a certaine kind of prerogative amongſt thoſe of the younger ſort of people. Truely, ſaid ſhe, as I cannot deny, but that this extraordinary courage you mention, is of a ſingular benefit to many ſorts of people, in their preſſing and difficult occaſions; yet when with a wiſe (though not a baſe) complyance, we can avoyd both the inconvenience and hazard to our ſelves, with more eaſe and no diſhonour, I ſee no reaſon, why we ſhould goe about to
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:98927:335"/>ſtraine nature to no purpoſe? eſpecially if we be not well aſſured to gaine a beneficiall victory by the contention; And if we faile in that we ſeem to undertake, we contract thereby a further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe and diſreputation to our ſelves, then if we had not at all offered to contend againſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and oppreſſion at the firſt: beſides oftentimes thoſe reſiſtances in the dark ſhall never come tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the knowledge of the world, ſo that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we faile then of that glory, our fooliſh and prepoſterous ambition aymed at by ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions: by which means we ſhall be rather enterpreted to be blown up with vain-glorious fumes, then ſeaſoned with true fortitude: In time the beſt mixture muſt be ſo to moderate our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that as precipitately we put not our ſelves upon vain and needleſſe ſufferings, without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, ſo ought not we too much to yield to the inconſtant ſtroakes of fortune and oppreſſion, when either honour or religion calls us to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique demonſtration of our bravery and courage. But however theſe diſputatious might either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme <hi>Cloria,</hi> or convert her brother, yet <hi>Aſcanius</hi> finding the opportunity, for his own deſired im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in the Kings affaires, he reſolved as ſoon as poſſible he could, to ſeek occaſion for his own ſpeedy departure; which did not a little afflict the conſiderations of his ſweet ſiſter the Princeſſe <hi>Cloria,</hi> who began to contract a moſt ſingular delight in the witty converſation of her deare brother. Nevertheleſſe ſhe reſolved not to be ſo great a friend to her own paſſions, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thereby an enemy to his honour, and her
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:98927:335"/>fathers proſperity: ſo that this being after ſome conſultation determined on all ſides, <hi>Aſcanius</hi> intended in ſome new diſguiſe, like a boy belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the Navy, to ſteale privately away to ſea, under the protection of thoſe officers that might afford him the conveniency, to repaire to thoſe ſhips that had revolted from the Senates ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</p>
